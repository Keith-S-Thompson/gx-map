Installation instructions for gx-map.

1.  Create a configuration file.  See sample.conf in this directory
    for an outline. Several other *.conf files are also included.

2.  Optionally create a customized version of the Gridmap_Valid_Mappings
    Perl module.  The default implementation only accepts mappings
    from the current namespace (see sample.conf for the definition of
    "namespace" in this context).  A customized version might recognize
    other mappings (perhaps to be downloaded from a web page), translate
    user names from one namespace to another, and so forth.

3.  In this directory, run
        ./configure-gx-map <...>.conf

4.  In this directory, run
        make install
    This must be done from the administrative account that will own
    the installed files (typically "globus" or "root").

5.  Set up cron jobs to be executed by the installation account
    (words in all-caps will need to be substituted).

5a. Check for new requests:
	DIR/sbin/gx-check-requests -namespace NAMESPACE

5b. Regenerate the grid-mapfile when necessary:
        DIR/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile MAPFILE
    If mapping are to be processed from multiple sources (including
    web pages), use the "-req" option; for example:
        DIR/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile -req default -req URL MAPFILE

5c. The gx-gen-mapfile command checks for updates to the /etc/passwd
    file.  On systems where new user accounts do not cause the
    /etc/passwd file to be updated (e.g., systems using YP/NIS),
    it may be necessary to run "gx-map -update" periodically.
