Installation instructions for gx-map.

1.  Create a configuration file.  See sample.conf in this directory
    for an outline.

2.  In this directory, run
        ./configure-gx-map <...>.conf

3.  In this directory, run
        make install
    This must be done from the administrative account that will own
    the installed files (typically "globus").

4.  Set up cron jobs to be executed by the installation account
    (words in all-caps will need to be substituted).

    4a. Check for new requests:
	    DIR/sbin/gx-check-requests -namespace NAMESPACE

    4b. Regenerate the grid-mapfile when necessary:
	    DIR/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile MAPFILE
	If mapping are to be processed from multiple sources (including
	web pages), use the "-req" option; for example:
	    DIR/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile -req default -req URL MAPFILE

    4c. The gx-gen-mapfile command checks for updates to the /etc/passwd
	file.  On systems where new user accounts do not cause the
	/etc/passwd file to be updated (e.g., systems using YP/NIS),
	it may be necessary to run "gx-map -update" periodically.

5.  If you want to use gx-ca-update to maintain CA certificates,
    CRLs, and signing_policy files, set up a cron job:

    DIR/gx-ca-update -ca b89793e4 \
		     -ca a7792cdb \
		     -target-dir /etc/grid-security/certificates

    Run "gx-ca-update -help" for a complete list of options.
    Please read README.CA and README.CA_SECURITY before using
    gx-ca-update.
