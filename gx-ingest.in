Reads an existing grid-mapfile (from stdin if no name is specified).

Writes on stdout a /bin/sh script that invokes gx-map for each entry
in the input grid-mapfile.  The generated script must be run by a
privileged user (see GLOBUS_ADMINS in your gx-map config file).

Be sure to check the generated script carefully before running it.
