Modify configure-gx-map so it takes command-line arguments specifying
the various configuration variables.  This creates a config file
to be installed in the INSTALL_DIR.

Specify all of them, and you're done.  Leave some out, and it creates
a config file setting them to "UNDEF", which triggers a run-time
message reminding you to update the config file.

PERL
	Defaults to first of
	    /usr/bin/perl
	    /usr/local/bin/perl
	that exists and is at least 5.006

PATH
	If not specified:
	Start with /bin:/usr/bin (unless they're the same
	directory, then start with just /usr/bin).
	If any of the required commands are missing, add
	/usr/local/bin if it helps.
	If any of the required commands are still missing,
	set to UNDEF and put a comment in the config file.

NAMESPACE
	Default to UNDEF

INSTALL_DIR
	Mandatory.  Allow "--prefix=dir".

DATA_DIR
	Mandatory.

REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS
	Default to 444.

GLOBUS_ADMINS
	Default to "globus" if the account exists.

ADMIN_EMAIL
	Default to UNDEF

VALID_MAPPINGS_FILE
	Commented out by default.

========================================================================

Another idea: In addition to PATH, optionally allow locations of
individual commands to be specified.  (For example, this lets gx-map
use /usr/local/bin/wget without adding /usr/local/bin to PATH.)

Something like

COMMAND wget /usr/local/bin/wget
COMMAND ncftpget /usr/local/bin/ncftpget

During configuration, don't automatically add /usr/local/bin to PATH;
if needed commands are found there, configure them separately.

Hmm.  Maybe we should drop PATH altogether and use full pathnames
for all external commands.  (Still need to set $PATH to something
reasonable for tainting purposes, but it doesn't need to be visibly
configurable.)

========================================================================

We need to be able to specify an existing DATA_DIR.  If it exists,
just set up the symlink (probably do some checking).  Question,
should we specify that it exists?  Given the new scheme, yes, it's
just a command-line argument; no point in specifying it in gx-map.conf,
since the directory exists by that time anyway.
