This is my first take on generating grid-mapfiles from info in the TGCDB.

You can find my script at
http://yams.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~brechin/mapgen.pl

Run as "./mapgen.pl $CLUSTER_NAME" where $CLUSTER_NAME is the same value as in
tgusage.  It is the resource name for your cluster.  It should be something like
dtf.ncsa.teragrid
abe.ncsa.teragrid
dtf.sdsc.teragrid
dtf.anl.teragrid

Please do not use this to recreate your grid-mapfiles right now.  It should
still be considered to be in the "testing" phase.  Please run it and compare to
your expectations.

About 10 seconds later, it will print out DN/username entries that bear a strong
resemblance to a grid-mapfile.  Right now it sorts the entries by username and
then by dn_id, which as far as I can tell from looking at the database is the
order they were added.

It should run wherever tgusage will run (it uses the same database modules),
though doesn't have to be run on the resource in question.  If anyone needs help
getting it working, or if you have any requests for additional/different
functionality to fit your needs, please let me know.

Thanks,
Jason
