# All attributes are mandatory.  Some may be left blank.  See the
# documentation for each attribute for details.
#

#
# The full path to the Perl interpreter.
# It must be at least version 5.006, and it must provide the following
# modules:
#     File::Basename  (standard)
#     File::Copy      (standard)
#     Getopt::Long    (standard)
#     Time::Local     (standard)
#     Cwd             (standard)
#
#     Net::Domain     (if missing, fall back to hostname command)
#
#     Time::HiRes     (standard in newer versions of Perl;
#                     if missing, fall back to external gettimeofday
#                     command, which must be installed separately)
#
# The following modules are required for TeraGrid systems only:
#     DBI             (needed by TeraGrid version of gx-propagate and
#                     the TGCDB subsystem)
#     DBD::Pg         (needed by DBI)
#
PERL               /usr/bin/perl

#
# The value to be used for $PATH.
# This will be used to find the following commands:
#     curl             (for downloading remote files)
#     rcs ci           (for RCS)
#     openssl          (to extract information from certificates)
#     gzip tar         (for gx-install-cadesc)
#     hostname         (ignored if Net::Domain Perl module is available)
#     mail or mailx    (optional; if missing, diagnostics will not be
#                       delivered by e-mail)
#     gettimeofday     (ignored if Time::HiRes Perl module is available;
#                       see INSTALL for details)
#
# Be sure that all specified directories, and all their parent
# directories, are writable only by trusted users.  If an attacker is
# able to install a Trojan openssl or curl, for example, he can break
# into another user's account.
#
PATH               /bin:/usr/bin

#
# The default namespace.
# A namespace, in this context, is a mapping of Unix user names and
# numeric UIDs to people.  (It may correspond to a DNS domain if all
# relevant systems within that domain have consistent user names and
# numeric UIDs.)
#
NAMESPACE          SAMPLE

#
# The installation directory for the gx-map package.
# The substring "%VERSION%" expands to the package version number.
# The gx-map package may be installed either in its own directory or
# in a shared directory (such as $GLOBUS_LOCATION).
#
INSTALL_DIR        /INSTALL/DIR/gx-map-%VERSION%

#
# The default directory containing data for the gx-map system.
# The substring "%VERSION%" expands to the package version number.
# On installation, INSTALL_DIR/gx-map-data will be created as a symlink
# to this directory.
#
DATA_DIR           /DATA/DIR/gx-map-%VERSION%-data

#
# Permissions for the requests.log file.
# Supported values are:
#     444 (world-readable)
#     440 (group-readable)
#     400 (readable only by owner)
#
REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS 444

#
# The name of the Unix account that owns the gx-map installation.
# This cannot be "root", or any account with UID 0.  This account
# must be used to run install-gx-map (invoked by "make install")
# and the gx-check-requests and gx-ca-update commands.
#
# Recommended practice is to use a non-personal account.  A dedicated
# "gxmap" account is the best choice.  The "globus" account is also
# a possibility, particularly if you choose to install gx-map under
# $GLOBUS_LOCATION.  Using a personal account can cause problems if the
# owner of the account leaves the organization; it's currently difficult
# to change configuration options without re-installing the package.
#
# The specified account is allowed to run the "gx-request" command on
# behalf of other users, so access to this account *must* be guarded as
# carefully as access to the root account.
#
GX_MAP_OWNER       sample

#
# A space-separated list of zero or more users who are allowed to
# run gx-map on behalf of other users.  These are in addition to the
# account specified in GX_MAP_OWNER.
#
# Recommended practice is to leave this empty, allowing
# only a single administrative account.  All the security
# considerations for GX_MAP_OWNER apply equally to each
# account listed in ADDITIONAL_ADMINS.
#
ADDITIONAL_ADMINS  

#
# An e-mail address for notifications of significant events.
#
ADMIN_EMAIL        sample@sample.edu

#
# If this is set to "yes", any non-admin "add" requests must be
# cryptographically signed with the certificate whose DN appears in the
# request.  A user must prove he/she owns a certificate before mapping it.
# A signature is not required for a "remove" or "remove-user" request;
# a "remove-dn" request requires administrative privileges.  The only
# permitted values are "yes" and "no".
#
REQUIRE_SIGNATURES no

#
# If REQUIRE_SIGNATURE is "yes", this specifies the directory containing
# the CA certificates needed to check signatures; otherwise it is ignored.
# A reasonable default is "/etc/grid-security/certificates".
#
CERTIFICATES_DIR   /etc/grid-security/certificates

#
# A Perl source file that implements the gx-propagate command,
# to be invoked as needed by gx-check-requests.  If not specified,
# no gx-propagate command will be installed; there is no default
# implementation.  (Currently, the distribution includes a dummy test
# version, "gx-propagate.in.test", and a TeraGrid-specific version,
# "gx-propagate.in.teragrid").  This may be left empty.
#
GX_PROPAGATE       

#
# The EXTRAS attribute can be used to specify additional components to be
# installed.  The only currently supported value is TGCDB, which causes a
# set of TeraGrid-specific tools to be installed.  This may be left empty.
#
EXTRAS
