# The full path to the Perl interpreter.

PERL            /usr/bin/perl

#
# The value to be used for $PATH.
# This will be used to find the following commands:
#     wget ncftpget (for downloading remote files)
#     rcs ci        (for RCS)
#     openssl

PATH            /bin:/usr/bin

#
# The default namespace.
# A namespace, in this context, is a mapping of Unix user names and
# numeric UIDs to people.  (It may correspond to a DNS domain if all
# relevant systems within that domain have consistent user names and
# numeric UIDs.)
#
NAMESPACE       CACR

#
# The installation directory for the gx-map package.
#
INSTALL_DIR     /home/kst/gx/apps/gx-map-0.4.0

#
# The default directory containing data for the gx-map system.
# On installation, INSTALL_DIR/var will be created as a symlink
# to this directory.

# Permissions for the requests.log file.
# Supported values are:

REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS 444

#
# A space-separated list of users who are allowed to run gx-map on behalf
# of other users.
# 
# It is recommended that this variable be set to a single non-human
# account name other than "root".  Making a human user an admin can cause
# problems if the account's owner leaves the organization.  Using "root"
# can cause problems if an NFS filesystem holding the data files is
# mounted in a way that maps the "root" account to "nobody".
# 
# The "globus" account is probably a good choice, or you can create a
# custom account (say, "gxmap") for the purpose.  Make sure that access
# to the administrative account is restricted to trusted users.
