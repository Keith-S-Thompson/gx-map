I've manually renamed some files in CVS (i.e., changed the names of
the corresponding *,v files in the CVS repository).  This was probably
not a good idea, since it can make it difficult to reproduce an older
release, or a snapshot as of a certain date.

The only renames that affect any releases are two *.cadesc files.
I've changed them back to their original names, created the new
versions as new files, and "cvs remove"d the old versions (so they're
still in the repository under their old names).

The affected files are:

Old name	New name		Revision		Date
========	========		========		====
ca/13eab55e-datagrid-es.cadesc
		ca/13eab55e.datagrid-es.cadesc
					1.2 (post-0.4.1)	2004/12/29

ca/2c7969d0.usc-pki-lite.cadesc
		ca/2c7969d0.usc-pki-lite-old.cadesc
					1.13 (post-0.4.1)	2005/02/08
