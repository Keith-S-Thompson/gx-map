=head1 NAME

gx-remove-locks - Remove B<gx-map> lock files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<gx-remove-locks -help>

S<gx-remove-locks -version>

S<gx-remove-locks>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-remove-locks>, part of the B<gx-map> system, is an administrative
command.  It checks the status of any lock files in the B<gx-map> data
directory.  For each lock file found, it asks whether to remove it.

Non-interactive use is not supported.

A lock file should only be removed if it's stale (e.g., if the command
that created it crashed before it was able to remove the lock).
Even then it's strongly recommended to determine why the command
crashed before removing the lock.

Lock files are created by the B<gx-ca-update> and B<gx-check-requests>
commands.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.

=over

=item B<-help>

Display a usage message and exit.
