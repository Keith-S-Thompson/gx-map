=head1 NAME

gx-dump-db - Dump information from the TGCDB to stdout

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<gx-dump-db -help>

S<gx-dump-db [options]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-dump-db> is part of the B<gx-map> system and of the optional
B<TGCDB> (TeraGrid Central Database) subsystem.  This subsystem
specific to the TeraGrid; it may or may not be installed on your
system.

B<gx-dump-db> is intended only for testing and debugging purposes.
It should not be run in normal production use.  Some invocations
may place a significant burden on the database server.  I wrote this
tool for my own testing as I was developing the B<TGCDB> subsystem;
there's probably no need to use it at all.

The B<gx-dump-db> command must be executed by the account that owns
the B<gx-map> installation; this is typically the "gxmap" or "globus"
account, but a different account can be configured when the B<gx-map>
system is installed.

It is not described here in great detail.  If you have any questions,
please contact the author.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.

=over

=item B<-help>

Display a usage message and exit.

=item B<-version>

Display the software version number and exit.

=item B<-db-config> I<FILE>

Specify a db-config file other than the default
F<etc/gx-map/tgcdb.db-config>.  This allows queries to a different
database, or with different parameters, than the default.

=item B<-raw>

By default, DNs are normalized (USERID --> UID, etc.), and DNs
that are the same after this normalization are displayed only once.
With the B<-raw> option, this is not done.

=item B<-all>

By default, the displayed information is filtered by resource name.
The B<-all> option causes all information for all resources to be
displayed.

=item B<-users>

Display only the "users" view.  Some other options will be ignored.

=item B<-people>

Display information from the "people" table.  Some other options will be ignored.

=item B<-debugging>

Enable debugging output.  This is intended for developer testing only.
