=head1 NAME

gx-request - Request a F<grid-mapfile> update

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<gx-request -help>

S<gx-request -interactive>

S<gx-request -long-help>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-request> is the client program for the B<gx-map> system.
It's used to submit a request for an update to the Globus grid-mapfile.

B<gx-request> is normally run in interactive mode, with the
I<-interactive> option.  Options can also be specified on the
command line; use the I<-long-help> option to display the full
set of options.

The B<gx-request> command creates a request file in the
F<var/new-requests> directory under the B<gx-map> installaton
directory.  This directory is world-writable, so the B<gx-request>
command requires no special privileges.  The request file is later
validated and processed by the B<gx-check-requests> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.

=over

=item B<-help>

Display a brief usage message and exit.

=item B<-version>

Display the software version number and exit.

=item B<-long-help>

Display a complete usage message and exit.  The usage message contains
descriptions of all command-line options, and is likely to be more
correct than this man page.

=item B<-interactive>

Run interactively.  Other options will be ignored.

=back

=head1 INTERACTIVE MODE

End users should normally use B<gx-request> in interactive mode
by entering the command S<C<gx-request -interactive>> (which may be
abbrevated to S<C<gx-request -int>>.

In this mode, the B<gx-request> command interactively prompts
the user to enter all the required information.  This information
includes the kind of request (add, remove, etc.), the DN (which may
be entered directly or extracted from a certificate or proxy file),
an optional e-mail address, and an optional comment.  If B<gx-request>
is executed in interactive mode by an administrator, it may prompt
for additional information.

Once all the necessary information has been collected, B<gx-request>
will ask for confirmation before submitting the request.

=head1 MORE OPTIONS

If you don't want to run the B<gx-request> command in interactive
mode, you can specify all required information on the command line.
This is recommended only for administrative use, such as in a script
performing multiple updates in batch mode.

Exactly one of the following options may be specified:
B<"-interactive">, B<"-add">, B<"-remove">, B<"-remove-dn">,
B<"-remove-user">, B<"-set">, B<"-update">, B<"-help">, B<"-usage">,
B<"-long-usage">.

=over

=item B<-add>

Request a mapping to be added to the F<grid-mapfile>.

=item B<-remove>

Request a mapping to be reomved from the F<grid-mapfile>.

=item B<-remove-dn>

Request that all mappings for a specified distinguished name be
removed.  Only a gx-map administrator may use this option.

=item B<-remove-user>

Request that all mappings for a specified user be removed.

=item B<-set>

Set mappings for a specified user.  Zero or more distinguished
names may be specified.  This is equivalent to a B<"remove-user">
request followed by zero or more B<"add"> requests.

The B<-proxy> and B<-certificate-file> options may not be used with B<-set>.

This option is not currently available in interactive mode.

=item B<-update>

Request an update of all F<grid-mapfile>s.  Normally, the system
detects when an update is required, so this option is not usually
necessary.

=item B<-quiet>

Work silently.  This implies the B<-force> option.

=item B<-force>

Apply the request without prompting for confirmation.  By default,
B<gx-request> will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

=item B<-no-admin>

Assume the user is not a gx-map administrator.  This is intended for
developer testing only.  This has no effect for a non-administrator

=item B<-dn "string">

Specify a distinguished name (also known as a subject name).
By default, this is extracted from your user certificate,
F<$HOME/.globus/usercert.pem>, if it exists.

=item B<-proxy>

Extract the distinguished name from a proxy certificate, either
B<$X509_USER_PROXY> or F</tmp/x509up_uNNN>, where NNN is a numeric
user id.

=item B<-certificate-file file>

Extract the distinguished name from the specified X509 certificate
file.

If none of B<"-dn">, B<"-proxy">, or B<"-certificate-file"> is
specified, the distinguished name (if needed) is extracted from
B<$X509_USER_CERT> or F<$HOME/.globus/usercert.pem>.

=item B<-force-dn>

Normally B<gx-request> does some minimal syntax checks on the
distinguished name; this option overrides those checks.

=item B<-username name>

Unix user name to map or unmap.  This option is for use by gx-map
administrators only.

=item B<-directory dir>

Specify an alternate data directory.  This option is for use by
gx-map administrators only, and is not recommended.  The default data
directory is the F<var> subdirectory of the B<gx-map> installation
(which is a symbolic link to the directory specified by the B<DATA_DIR>
option in the installation configuration file).

=item B<-email addr>

Your contact e-mail address (optional).  This is stored in the
F<requests.log> file.  It may be used to contact you if there's a
problem with your certificate.

=item B<-no-email>

This option is ignored.  It's provided for compatibility with B<gx-map>
release 0.3.  It may be removed in a future release.

=item B<-comment "string">

A comment to be added to the F<requests.log> file.  This is optional.

=item B<-source string>

Specify the source of the mapping.  This option is for use by gx-map
administrators only.  The argument may consist only of letters,
digits, underscore, period, and hyphen characters ([A-Za-z0-9_.-]).
It is intended to indicate where the mapping came from.  See the
B<gx-propagate(8)> man page for more information.

=item B<-debugging>

Enable debugging output.  This is intended for developer testing only.
