gx-convert-log - Convert a F<requests.log> file from a previous version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<gx-convert-log -help>

S<gx-convert-log -version>

S<gx-convert-log [options] [files]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-convert-log>, part of the B<gx-map> system, is an administrative
command.  It reads an existing F<requests.log> file, possibly from
and older release of the B<gx-map> system.  It writes to stdout a
F<requests.log> file compatible with the current release of B<gx-map>.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.

=item <-force>
