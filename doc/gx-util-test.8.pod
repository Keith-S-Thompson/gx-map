=head1 NAME

gx-util-test - Test utility for GX module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<gx-util-test -help>

S<gx-util-test -version>

S<gx-util-test command [options]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-util-test>, part of the B<gx-map> system, is intended for
developer testing.  It allows unit testing of functions in the
B<GX> Perl package.

Run with the B<-help> option for a list of commands.  Command
names correspond to function names in the B<GX> package, but are
case-sensitive.  '-' and '_' characters are ignored.  Not all functions
are supported.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.
