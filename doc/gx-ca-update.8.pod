=head1 NAME

gx-ca-update - Maintain certificate authority files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

gx-ca-update -help

gx-ca-update [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-ca-update> is part of the B<gx-map> system.  It is used to
maintain the CA (Certificate Authority) files (signing certificates,
signing_policy files, and CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists)) used
by Globus.

B<gx-ca-update> is normally run from a cron job.  It attempts to
update the files for a specified set of certificate authorities.

It uses a caching mechanism to avoid downloading files unless they've
been updated.

=head1 EXAMPLES

A typical cron job entry might look something like this:

    0,30 * * * * [...]/sbin/gx-ca-update
	         -target-dir [...]/certificates
	         -ca-list [...]/certificates/.list

In real life, the entire cron job entry has to be on a single line,
and the "[...]"s need to be replaced with actual directory names.

This cron job runs every 30 minutes.  It maintains the F<*.0>,
F<*.signing_policy>, and F<*.r0> files for the CAs listed in the
F<.list> file.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.

=over

=item B<-help>

Display a usage message and exit.  The usage message contains
descriptions of all command-line options, and is likely to be more
correct than this man page.

=item B<-version>

Display the software version number and exit.

=item B<-ca> I<name>

Name of a certificate authority.  Normally this is given as the
8-digit hexadecimal hash value, but a brief name can also be used;
use B<-list-cas> to see a list.  This option may be given multiple
times, and/or the argument may be a list of CA names separated by
commas or blanks (in the latter case, the argument must be quoted).

=item B<-ca-list> I<file>

Name of a text file containing a list of CAs.  This option may be
given multiple times.

=item B<-list-cas>

Show a list of available CAs and exit.

=item B<-list-all-cas>

Like B<-list-cas>, but include disabled CAs as well.

=item B<-target-dir> I<dir>

Specify the target directory.  Typically this will be either
F</etc/grid-security/certificates> or a directory to which
F</etc/grid-security/certificates> is a symbolic link.

=item B<-[no]download>

By default, B<gx-ca-update> attempts to download files as needed.
With B<-nodownload>, use only existing files in the cache directory.

This can be useful if multiple instances of B<gx-map> are being used
on several systems with a shared data directory.  One instance can
run in the default B<-download> mode, and all the others can depend
on the cache files, saving time and network traffic.

=item B<-permissions> I<perm>

Specify the permissions, in octal, for the installed files.  The
default is 444; there is rarely any reason to use a different value.

=item B<-gt3-compatible>

Generate *.signing_policy files compatible with GT3 web services tools.
This should rarely be necessary or useful.  By default, generated
*.signing_policy files are compatible with both GT2 and GT4, and with
GT3 pre-WS (so no B<-gt2-compatible> option is needed).

=item B<-force>

Force file updates.  This applies to certificates, signing_policy
files, and CRLs.

=item B<-email>

Send e-mail to the configured B<ADMIN_EMAIL> address on errors.
This is set by default; use B<-noemail> to disable e-mail messages.

=item B<-verbose>

Print verbose messages.

=item B<-debugging>

Enable debugging output.  Not recommended.

=head1 FILES

The B<gx-ca-update> command uses information in a set of CA description
files installed in the F<etc/gx-map/ca-config> subdirectory under the
B<gx-map> installation directory.  Currently, there are configuration
files for 88 different CAs.

Each CA certificate has an 8-digit hexadecimal hash value associated
with it.  The files maintained by B<gx-ca-update> have names based on
this hash value.  For example, the SDSC CA's hash value is 3deda549;
the corresponding files are:

3deda549.0, the signing certificate

3deda549.signing_policy, the signing policy file.

3deda549.r0, the certificate revocation list

Since the certificate is updated only rarely, B<gx-ca-update>
normally only installs it once; it doesn't attempt to re-install
it unless the B<-force> option is specified.

The signing_policy file is generated by B<gx-ca-update>, even if a copy
is available from the CA's web site.  This allows for a consistent
format for all installed signing_policy files.  There are also some
changes that need to be made for some files for compatibility with
different versions of Globus; the files distributed by the CAs don't
always have these changes.

Typically, the CRL has a relatively short lifetime; it's re-issued
both periodically and immediately when a certificate is revoked.
B<gx-ca-update> checks the CRL each time it runs, and downloads and
installs it if it's been updated.

=head1 SECURITY

Incorrectly installed CA files can open serious security holes.
For example, an attacker could create a fake signing certificate
with the same hash and subject name as an existing CA certificate,
and then sign a user certificate matching an existing one, giving the
attacker access to the target user's account.  (The 8-digit hash is
computed from the certificate's subject name; it's a convenient way
to identify the certificate, but it's not secure.)

To prevent this, B<gx-ca-update> confirms the MD5 and SHA1 checksums
of any downloaded certificate before installing it.  The checksums
are compared to the ones specified in the corresponding F<*.cadesc>
file, which are based on my own download and manual check of the file.
To get past this check, an attacker would have to have taken control
of the CA web site both when I checked the certificate and when
B<gx-ca-update> attempts to download it.

Before each CRL is installed, B<gx-ca-update> confirms that it was
cryptographically signed by the corresponding certificate.

I've done my best to make the entire B<gx-map> system as secure
as possible.  Nevertheless, ...

=head1 GUARANTEES

None.  If you install this software and it breaks your system, it's
your own fault for trusting me.
