=head1 NAME

gx-admins - Determine the set of admins for an existing F<requests.log> file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<gx-admins -help>

S<gx-admins -version>

S<gx-admins logfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gx-admins>, part of the B<gx-map> system, is an administrative
command.  It reads an existing F<requests.log> file, possibly from
an older release of the B<gx-map> system.  By searching for entries
for which the user making the request differs from the user to which
the request applies, it determines which accounts were enabled as
administrative accounts.

The B<gx-admins> command can be used in conjunction with the
B<gx-convert-log> command.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option processing is done using the Perl B<Getopt::Long> module.

Options may be specified with a single or double leading '-' character.
Option names may be abbreviated to whatever is unique.  Arguments may
be separated either by a blank or by an '=' character.  For example,
"-foobar 42", "--foobar=42", and "-foob 42" would all be equivalent.

=over

=item B<-help>
