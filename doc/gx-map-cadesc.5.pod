=head1 NAME

gx-map cadesc - The cadesc file format used by B<gx-map>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A F<cadesc> file is a plain text file containing the information
needed for the B<gx-ca-update> command to work with a CA (Certificate
Authority).

The F<cadesc> files are installed under the F<etc/ca-config> directory
of the B<gx-map> installation directory.  A number of these files
are provided with the B<gx-map> distribution.  Users can also create
their own F<cadesc> files (and are encouraged to send them to the
author for inclusion in future B<gx-map> releases).

The name of each file is of the form
F<E<lt>hashE<gt>>.F<E<lt>nameE<gt>>.F<cadesc>, where F<E<lt>hashE<gt>>
is the 8-digit hexadecimal hash value that identifies the CA's
signing certificate, and F<E<lt>nameE<gt>> is a brief name for the CA.
For example, the description file for the SDSC Certificate Authority
is F<3deda549.sdsc.cadesc>.

A F<cadesc> file is a plain text file where each line contains an
attribute name followed by the corresponding attribute value.

More details to follow when I update this man page.
