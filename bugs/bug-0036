gx-map bug 0036
Date: Wed 2005-06-29
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: Rename field "map_to_name" to "username"

Summary:
The field name "map_to_name" is inconsistent with the gx-request
option name "-username".  It's also a bit clumsy.  Two of the
most important fields in a request are the DN and the user name.
Calling them "dn" and "username" is cleaner.

Proposed solution:
Rename the "map_to_name" field to "username".
Rename the "map_to_uid" field to "user_uid".

Modify gx-convert-logs to change any "map_to_name" and "map_to_uid"
fields to "username" and "user_uid", respectively.

Fix all occurences of "map_to_name" and "map_to_uid" in all files.

Fixed:
Multiple files.
