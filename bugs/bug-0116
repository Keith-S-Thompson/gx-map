gx-map bug 0116
Date: Tue 2006-09-12
Severity: Med
Reported by: Krishna Muriki <kmuriki@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2
Status: Open
Title: gx-convert-log should strip proxy info

Currently, gx-convert-log filters all DNs using the GT4_Subject
function.  It should use Normalize_DN instead.  (The difference is
that Normalize_DN also strips proxy information.)
