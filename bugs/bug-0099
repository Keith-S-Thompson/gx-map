gx-map bug 0099
Date: Wed 2006-06-28
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1.019
Status: Fixed 0.5.2.2.003
Title: Bad signing_policy files generated

Summary:
For certain CAs, gx-ca-update can generate an invalid signing_policy
file.  This occurs only if the *.cadesc file has "MAY_SIGN ?".
All such cadesc files have "DISABLE yes", so this can happen only
with the use of the "-UNSAFE" and "-ignore-disable" options.

The affected cadesc files (corresponding to CAs for which I've been
unable to find a valid signing_policy) are:

    12a1d8c2.grid-fr.cadesc
    2fcac3ee.birn.cadesc
    3a0abe12.malaysia.cadesc
    473c3beb.nees.cadesc
    6acd1142.ocikbserver1.cadesc
    6b4ddd18.cnrs-datagrid.cadesc
    cb7b413d.ecmwf.cadesc
    d8501632.ocikbserver1.cadesc

gx-ca-update should refuse to install any files when there's no valid
MAY_SIGN attribute.

On further thought, generating a bad signing_policy file is ok.
It will make the CA certificate unusable, which is just what we want.
Add a warning comment to the signing_policy file, and generate an
error message.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.119
gx-map release 0.5.2.2.003
