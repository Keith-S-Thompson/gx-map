gx-map bug 0098
Date: Tue 2006-06-20
Severity: medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1.018
Status: Open
Title: Collect DB code into a separate module

Summary:
There are three commands in the gx-map system that interact with
the TGCDB: gx-propagate.in.teragrid, gx-db-check-requests.in, and
gx-db-dump.in.  There's a fair amount of duplicated code.  It should
be collected into a single module.

Consider making gx-propagate.in.teragrid part of the "EXTRAS TGCDB"
subsystem (but we still want to be able to install a "gx-propagate"
command that's not part of the TGCDB subsystem -- I think).
