gx-map bug 0080
Date: Thu 2006-03-23
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0e5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0e6
Title: gx-gen-mapfile chokes on incomplete requests.log

Summary:
The gx-check-requests command appends information to the requests.log
file.  The intent is that, if gx-gen-mapfile reads requests.log as
it's being written, and sees an incomplete final record, the lat
record will be silently ignored.

It turns out that if the incomplete final records ends in an incomplete
line, it can cause the Read_Records function to report an error.

This produced the following error message:
Syntax error at line 44750 of /projects/globus/globus/solaris/apps/gx-map-0.5.0e5/var/requests.log
Traceback:
    /projects/globus/globus/solaris/apps/gx-map-0.5.0e5/lib/Gridmap_Utils.pm:987 in Gridmap_Utils::Read_Records
    /projects/globus/globus/solaris/apps/gx-map-0.5.0e5/lib/Gridmap_Utils.pm:1135 in Gridmap_Utils::Gen_Mappings
    /projects/globus/globus/solaris/apps/gx-map-0.5.0e5/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile:216

(The line numbers refer to Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.166 and
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.81.)

The line in requests.log was:
        requested_by_name  globus
Probably on the field name was there when gx-gen-mapfile tried to
read it.  The problem went away when I re-ran gx-gen-mapfile.

Proposed solution:
Don't report syntax errors within records.  Instead, set an ad-hoc
attribute in the record, and report the error only if the attribute
is set on reaching the closing '}' (i.e., on completing the record).
If the record is never completed, ignore the error.

Actually, there's no need for an ad-hoc attribute; just use a local
variable.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.167
gx-map release 0.5.0e6
