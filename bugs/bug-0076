gx-map bug 0076
Date: Wed 2006-03-01
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d9
Status: Fixed 0.5.0e0
Title: Tainted permissions for chmod

Summary:
The "-permissions" option to gx-gen-mapfile and gx-ca-update sets the
specified permissions for any created files.  The default permissions
are 444.

If this option is specified, the permissions value are derived from
the command-line argument and are therefore tainted.  This results
in an error message:

Insecure dependency in chmod while running with -T switch at \
    [...]/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile line 368.
Traceback:
    [...]/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-gen-mapfile:368

or:

Insecure dependency in chmod while running with -T switch at \
    [...]/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-ca-update line 1093.
Traceback:
    [...]/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-ca-update:1093 in main::Update_And_Install_CRL
    [...]/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-ca-update:357

If the option is not specified, the permissions value come from a
constant in the code and is therefore not tainted.

Proposed fix:
Untaint the value derived from the command-line option.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.102
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.81
gx-map release 0.5.0e0
