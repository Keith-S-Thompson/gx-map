gx-map bug 0120
Date: Wed 2006-11-08
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2.022
Status: Open
Title: gx-ingest needs better error checking

If gx-ingest is invoked with a grid-mapfile that contains
syntax errors, it quietly generates an invalid shell script;
when the script is executed, the error may not be detected until
a number of lines later.  The particular case I ran into was
/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile on co-login1.ncsa.teragrid.org,
which has a stray quotation mark.
