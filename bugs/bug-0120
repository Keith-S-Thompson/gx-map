gx-map bug 0120
Date: Wed 2006-11-01
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2
Status: Open
Title: Forbid '"' character in DN

A '"' character in a DN creates a syntax error.

This commonly occurs as a result of user error, e.g., when a user tries
to do a copy-and-paste from an entry in an existing grid-mapfile and
catches the entire line rather than just the DN.

Check for this in gx-request (if "-force-dn" hasn't been specified).
