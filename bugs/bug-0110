gx-map bug 0110
Date: Thu 2006-08-10
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: Feature: Filter DNs by signing_policy files

Consider adding an option to gx-gen-mapfile:
    -policy-directory <dir>
The directory (typically /etc/grid-security/certificates) is searched
for xxxxxxxx.signing_policy files.  Each matching file is searched
for lines of the form
    cond_subjects  globus  <pattern>
DNs not matching any of the patterns are excluded from the generated
grid-mapfile.

By default, DNs are included regardless of any signing policies.

(How much would this slow things down?)
