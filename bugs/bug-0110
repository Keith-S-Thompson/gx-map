gx-map bug 0110
Date: Thu 2006-08-10
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: Feature: Filter DNs by signing_policy files

Consider adding an option to gx-gen-mapfile:
    -policy-directory <dir>
The directory (typically /etc/grid-security/certificates) is searched
for xxxxxxxx.signing_policy files.  Each matching file is searched
for lines of the form
    cond_subjects  globus  <pattern>
DNs not matching any of the patterns are excluded from the generated
grid-mapfile.

By default, DNs are included regardless of any signing policies.

(How much would this slow things down?)

Note that the *.signing_policy files would have to be treated as inputs
for the grid-mapfile -- i.e., we need to re-generate the grid-mapfile
if any signing_policy file is newer than the grid-mapfile.

(Or administrators could be advised to run "gx-gen-mapfile -force"
whenever a signing_policy file is added, removed, or updated, but
that's ugly.)
