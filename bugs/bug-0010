gx-map bug 0010
Date: Sun 2005-03-27
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Open
Title: New command: gx-check-grid-security

Summary:
Provide a new command, gx-check-grid-security, that checks a directory
(/etc/grid-security by default) for consistency and correctness.

Compare grid-mapfile for consistency with one newly generated
by gx-gen-mapfile and/or for internal consistency.  See also
<http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3520>.

For each file certificates/xxxxxxxx.0, check xxxxxxxx.0, xxxxxxxx.r0,
xxxxxxxx.signing_policy.  Check against downloaded versions and/or
check for internal consistency.  Warn about overly permissive
signing_policy.
