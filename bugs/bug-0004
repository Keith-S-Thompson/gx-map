gx-map bug 0004
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Title: New feature: In gx-ca-update, apply options to individual CAs.

Summary:
New feature: In gx-ca-update, apply options to individual CAs.

Currently the following command-line options:
    -UNSAFE
    -allow-missing-crl
    -expire-crl time
    -warn-crl time
    -force
    -ignore-disable
apply globally to all "-ca ......." arguments.

Keep that as it is, and additionally allow options to apply to
individual CAs.

For example, TeraGrid might use:

    gx-ca-update -target-dir /usr/local/apps/grid-security/certificates \
		 -ca 01621954 \
		 -ca 1c3f2ca8 \
		 -ca 26bf3386:UNSAFE:allow-missing-crl \
		 -ca 2ca73e82 \
		 -ca 34a5e0db \
		 -ca 3deda549 \
		 -ca 4a6cd8b1 \
		 -ca 67e8acfa \
		 -ca 85ca9edc:UNSAFE:allow-missing-crl \
		 -ca 95009ddc \
		 -ca 9a1da9f9 \
		 -ca aa99c057 \
		 -ca b89793e4 \
		 -ca d1b603c3

26bf3386 and 85ca9edc are the USC and PSC Kerberos CAs, respectively;
they have no CRLs.

Note that the fix for bug-0005 addresses the particular case that
motivated this idea.  I've lowered the priority of this bug report
(unless I can think of another reason that it's necessary).
