gx-map bug 0016
Date: Sun 2005-04-17
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0b7
Title: Check grid-mapfile into RCS

Summary:
In gx-gen-mapfile, if the grid-mapfile is updated, check it into
an RCS directory.
Add a "-norcs" option to disable this.
(Don't try to do this if writing to stdout.)

The file checked into RCS is the specified file with ".rcs" appended
to its name.  Checking in the actual file would modify the file in
place, causing possible synchronization problems.

Fixed:
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.73
gx-map release 0.5.0b7
