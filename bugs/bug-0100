gx-map bug 0100
Date: Sat 2006-07-01
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1.019
Status: Open
Title: Possible glitch in locking code

My test installation of gx-map 0.5.1.019 on
tg-login-linux.purdue.teragrid.org ran into a locking problem in
gx-db-check-requests.  It could have been either a filesystem problem
or a problem (race condition?) in the locking code.

The error message (sent by e-mail) was:

/home/clerk/u76/kst/linux-x86/apps/gx-map-0.5.1.019/gx-map-data/.gx-db-check-requests.lock: No such file or directory

Attempts after that resulted in:

Locked since Sat 2006-07-01 17:43:01 UTC (301 second(s))
gx-db-check-requests (gx-map 0.5.1.019) PID=15729 on tg-login-linux.rcac.purdue.edu
Consider running gx-remove-locks

Correcting this is easy enough; just run gx-remove-locks.
