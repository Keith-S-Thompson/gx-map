gx-map bug 0115
Date: Sat 2006-09-02
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2
Status: Open
Title: Warn about DNs that are handled automatically

At SDSC, cron jobs automatically invoke gx-request for new, expired,
and revoked user certificates issued by the NPACI and SDSC CAs.
Users are not always aware of this, and they often invoke gx-map or
gx-request manually.

Add a configuration option of some sort to specify which DNs are
handled automatically.  If a user tries to invoke gx-request with a
matching DN, issue a warning.
