gx-map bug 0115
Date: Sat 2006-09-02
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.2.2.008
Title: Warn about DNs that are handled automatically

At SDSC, cron jobs automatically invoke gx-request for new, expired,
and revoked user certificates issued by the NPACI and SDSC CAs.
Users are not always aware of this, and they often invoke gx-map or
gx-request manually.

Add a configuration option of some sort to specify which DNs are
handled automatically.  If a user tries to invoke gx-request with a
matching DN, issue a warning.

Fix:
Add a list of patterns (similar to those in a signing_policy file) in
etc/gx-map/auto.txt.  If a DN matches one of the specified patterns,
gx-request prints a warning before submitting the request (unless
"-force" or "-quiet" is specified).

Fixed:
auto.txt 1.1
install-gx-map.in 1.85
gx-request.in 1.52
gx-map release 0.5.2.2.008
