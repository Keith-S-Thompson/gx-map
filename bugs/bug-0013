gx-map bug 0013
Date: Tue 2005-03-29
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update should allow DER and NET format certificates

Summary:
Globus requires certificates, keys, and CRLs to be in PEM format.
For CAs that provide files in DER format, gx-ca-update should be able
to download the files in DER format and use OpenSSL to convert them
to PEM format; likewise for NET format (which seems to apply only
to certificates, not to CRLs.)  It should automatically detect the
format of the downloaded file and convert to PEM if necessary.

The CESNET CA's CRL is available only in DER format; see
ed99a497.cesnet.cadesc.
