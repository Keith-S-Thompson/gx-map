gx-map bug 0102
Date: Mon 2006-07-17
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update -no-target-directory

Consider adding a "-no-target-directory" to gx-ca-update.  With this
option, it would download files as necessary and update the cache
directory, but would not install anything.  For a site with multiple
nodes running gx-ca-update with a shared data directory, a master
node could run "gx-ca-update -no-target-directory", and the other
nodes could run "gx-ca-update -readonly" (see bug-0101).

This is likely to be more effort than it's worth; you'd probably want
to update a certificates directory on the master node anyway.
