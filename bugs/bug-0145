gx-map bug 0145
Date: Thu 2007-04-05
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.3.2.023
Title: More flexible handling of SIGNED_BY in cadesc files

Currently, if a CA certificate is self-signed, the SIGNED_BY attribute
is omitted; if it's not self-signed, the SIGNED_BY attribute specifies
the DN of the signer.

Instead:

If SIGNED_BY is missing, assume the certificate is self-signed (as
is done currently).

If SIGNED_BY is set to "self", the certificate is self-signed.

Otherwise, SIGNED_BY specifies the DN of the signer.  This is allowed
to be the certificate's own DN if it's self-signed.

Correction: for a self-signed certificate, SIGNED_BY must be either
"self" or omitted.  Allowing it to match SUBJECT could lead to
copy-and-paste errors.

This is upward compatible, but allows self-signed certificates to be
indicated more clearly.

Update all existing cadesc files to use "SIGNED_BY self" for
self-signed certificates.  (This will need to be filtered out when
generating cadesc tarballs for older releases.)

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1,147
GX.pm.in 1.24
gx-map release 0.5.3.2.024
