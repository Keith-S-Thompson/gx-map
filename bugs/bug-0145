Date: Thu 2007-04-05
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: More flexible handling of SIGNED_BY in cadesc files

Currently, if a CA certificate is self-signed, the SIGNED_BY attribute
is omitted; if it's not self-signed, the SIGNED_BY attribute specifies
the DN of the signer.

Instead:

If SIGNED_BY is missing, assume the certificate is self-signed (as
is done currently).

If SIGNED_BY is set to "self", the certificate is self-signed.

Otherwise, SIGNED_BY specifies the DN of the signer.  This is allowed
to be the certificate's own DNi if it's self-signed.

This is upward compatible, but allows self-signed certificates to be
indicated more clearly.

Update all existing cadesc files to use "SIGNED_BY self" for
self-signed certificates.  (This will need to be filtered out when
generating cadesc tarballs for older releases.)
