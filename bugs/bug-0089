gx-map bug 0089
Date: Fri 2006-04-28
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: Create dummy tgcdb.conf file

Summary:
The TeraGrid-specific version of gx-propagate depends on a tgcdb.conf
file, which must be installed in the etc/gx-map subdirectory.  Since
this file contains a plain-text password, it must be installed with
permissions 400 or 600 -- but this isn't checked until gx-propagate
tries to use it, at which point it may be too late.

If the installation config file specifies gx-propagate.teragrid.in,
create a dummy tgcdb.conf file with permissions 600, and tell the
installer that it needs to be edited.  gx-propagate should bail out
if the file exists and hasn't yet been updated (to avoid missing any
required propagations).

Note: the tgcdb.conf file has been renamed to tgcdb.db-config.

Fixed:
gx-propagate.in.teragrid 1.30
gx-check-requests.in 1.94
install-gx-map.in 1.64
gx-map release 0.5.2
