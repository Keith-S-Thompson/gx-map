gx-map bug 0049
Date: Sun 2005-09-11
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a9
Title: How to handle https:// URLs

Summary:
Different versions of wget handle https:// URLs differently.
Versions up to 1.6 don't handle them at all.  Versions 1.7 through
1.9.1 can optionally be configured with SSL support.  Starting in
version 1.10, wget requires the host certificate for the server,
unless the "--no-check-certificate" option is given.

As a result, if you have wget version 1.10 or newer, gx-map
(particularly gx-ca-update) will not be able to download files from
https servers.

One possible fix is to use wget with the "--no-check-certificate"
option *if* the URL uses https *and* the version (checked with
"wget --version") is 1.10 or higher.

A better solution is to implement the fix for bug-0022: stop using
wget and use curl instead.  "curl --head <url>" shows the timestamp
of the file without downloading it.  "curl -s -o <filename> <url>"
will download to a specified file.  "curl --silent --dump-header
<filename>.head -o <filename> <url>" will get both the header and
the file.

There's still a potential problem with server certificates.  The client
either has to have a copy of the signing certificate for the CA that
issued the server certificate, or it has to ignore the certificate.
curl seems more flexible in this area; recent versions use an installed
bundle of CA certificates that can be reconfigured if necessary.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.107
gx-ca-update.in 1.74
gx-map release 0.5.0a9
The new caching mechanism uses curl rather than wget and ncftpget.
Unlike wget, curl is distributed with a collection of CA signing
certificates, used to validate web sites.  Not all sites use a
certificate provided with curl, but the collection can be configured,
either by updating the curl installation or by using an environment
variable to point to a local collection.
