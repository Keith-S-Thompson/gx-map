gx-map bug 0003
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1

Summary:
"ci" command can change requests.log permissions.

gx-check-requests does the following when it needs to update
the requests.log file:

    chmod 644 requests.log
    append new text to requests.log
    chmod 444 requests.log
    rcs -l requests.log
    ci -u -f requests.log

(This assumes REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS = 444.)

The intent is to leave the permissions on requests.log set to 444,
but the "ci" command causes it to inherit the permissions of the
RCS/requests.log,v file.

Suggested fix:
Set the permissions on both requests.log and RCS/requests.log,v
(It might also be good to check whether the RCS directory exists.)
