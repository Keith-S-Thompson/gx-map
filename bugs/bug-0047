gx-map bug 0047
Date: Wed 2005-08-03
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: Configure e-mail program

Summary:
Currently, gx-ca-update searches for "mail" or "mailx" in a fixed
sequence of directories.  Instead, configure the mail program as is
done for other commands.  Document the requirements in sample.conf:
    Must accept <program> -s "subject" address
    with the message on stdin.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.88
gx-map release 0.5.0a2

The new Send_Email function uses "mailx" if it's available; otherwise
it falls back to "mail".  It searches for the commands in the
configured $PATH.
