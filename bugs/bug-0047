gx-map bug 0047
Date: Wed 2005-08-03
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Open
Title: Configure e-mail program

Summary:
Currently, gx-ca-update searches for "mail" or "mailx" in a fixed
sequence of directories.  Instead, configure the mail program as is
done for other commands.  Document the requirements in sample.conf:
    Must accept <program> -s "subject" address
    with the message on stdin.
