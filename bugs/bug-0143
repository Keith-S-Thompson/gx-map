gx-map bug 0143
Date: Thu 2007-03-29
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Consider adding "gx-db-request -remove-user", "-remove-dn"

Consider adding "-remove-user" and "-remove-dn" options to
gx-db-request.  "-remove-user" would request removal of all mappings
for the specified user from the tgcdb-mappings file.  "-remove-dn"
would do likewise for a specified DN.  These could be used in
processing AMIE packets that specify removal of all mappings for a
specified user without specifying any DNs, or vice versa.

As with any deletion from the tgcdb-mappings file, this would cause
individual "gx-request -remove" requests to be submitted for each
mapping.

According to Michael Shapiro, no such AMIE packets currently exist
or are expected to be introduced, so this is unlikely to be useful.
I'm just recording this for future reference, since it would be
straightforward to implement.
