gx-map bug 0040
Date: Fri 2005-07-01
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0b3
Title: Add "-merge" option to gx-gen-mapfile

Summary:
Add a "-merge" option to gx-gen-mapfile.  The argument is an externally
generated grid-mapfile whose contents are merged into the generated
grid-mapfile.  (To do: decide how to determine the order of user names
if the same DN appears in requests.log and the external grid-mapfile;
there will be no timestamp information.)

This could be useful for dynamic or pool accounts, where the
association with DNs can change rapidly.  Using gx-request for each
update could cause the requests.log file to grow.

Fixed:
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.72
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.114
gx-map release 0.5.0b1
