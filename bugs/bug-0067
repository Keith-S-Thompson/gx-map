gx-map bug 0067
Date: Wed 2006-01-25
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d1
Title: Think about DoS attacks on new-requests directory

Summary:
The var/new-requests directory is world-writable.  This opens the
possibility of a denial-of-service attack.  A malicious user (or a
buggy program) could fill the directory with huge files, or with huge
numbers of files.

gx-check-requests currently only looks at files with names ending in
".request".  Consider checking for *all* files (the only other valid
file name is ".update").  Automatically removing them might be a bad
idea, but it could at least send an e-mail message.

Also, treat any request file over a certain size as a bad request
file.  It will still be moved to the bad_requests directory (which
means it will take up just as much space), but it will result in an
e-mail warning.  The largest request file I've seen "in the wild"
is 509 bytes, so 2 Kbytes should be a reasonable upper bound.

I might consider having gx-request die if the generated request file
is too big, but that's probably not worth the effort.

Fix summary:
Reject a request for any of the following:
    File name doesn't end in '.request'.
    File size exceeds 2048 bytes.
    File is not a regular file.
    File is not readable.

Some of these may make it impossible to move the file into the
bad-requests directory; in that case, an e-mail error message will be
sent repeatedly until the file is removed manually *and* information
about the request will be repeatedly appended to errors.log.

Fixed:
gx-check-requests.in 1.82
gx-map release 0.5.0d1
