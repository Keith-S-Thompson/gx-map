gx-map bug 0136
Date: Fri 2007-02-09
Severity: Urgent
Reported by: Benjamin Bennett <ben@psc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.3.3
Title: Race condition in gx-gen-mapfile

See e-mail exchange with ben@psc.edu starting Fri 2007-02-09.

An exploit was demonstrated.

Actually, guessing the name of the temporary file is not necessary;
it should also be possible to exploit the race condition by examining
all files in /tmp.

As of 0.5.3.3, gx-gen-mapfile no longer writes the grid-mapfile to
a temporary location before copying it; instead, it writes it to a
temporary file in the same directory as its target.  The ability to
write multiple grid-mapfiles has been removed; gx-gen-mapfile writes
either to a single specified file, or to stdout.

As a result of this bug and bug-0135, release 0.5.3.2 and all earlier
releases are now unsupportd; all users should upgrade to 0.5.3.2p1
or 0.5.3.3.

Fixed:
gx-map release 0.5.3.3
