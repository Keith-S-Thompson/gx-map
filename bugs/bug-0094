gx-map bug 0094
Date: Tue 2006-05-30
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Fixed 0.5.1.012
Title: Race condition creating RCS directory

Summary:
gx-gen-mapfile, by default, creates an RCS directory in the target
directory for the generated grid-mapfile, if the RCS directory doesn't
already exist.

If the RCS directory doesn't exist, and two instances of gx-gen-mapfile
are run simultaneously, one of the instances can see that the RCS
directory doesn't exist, then attempt to create it after the other
instance has already done so.  It the dies with an error message.

Proposed solution: If the RCS directory doesn't exist, attempt to
create it.  After the mkdir call, check whether it exists; report
mkdir's error only if it doesn't.

Fixed:
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.84
gx-map release 0.5.1.012
