I think this refers to the CAs listed on
<https://www.tacar.org/certs.html>, which is linked from
<http://www.tacar.org/>.  Awaiting more information from JP.

Fixed:
I've added cadesc files for all CAs in the IGTF 1.13 distribution,
<http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/1.13/>.  These will be
included in the 0.6.X release.
