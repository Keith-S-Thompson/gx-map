gx-map bug 0130
Date: Tue 2007-01-23
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Consider restricting whitespace in requests.log

Currently, Gridmap_Utils::Read_Records allows and ignores arbitrary
whitespace at the beginning and end of each line, and between a key
and value.  There are several regexps containing "\s*" or "\s+".

Consider eliminating this, requiring either no whitespace or a fixed
amount.  This could make the file smaller and make reading it faster.
It could make it more difficult for humans to read and edit, but that's
not a huge drawback; the file is machine-generated, and it would be
easy enough to provide a filter to add whitespace for readability.

Things to think about:

What about comments?

We should still allow for possible CR-LF line endings (currently a
trailing CR is stripped as whitespace).

How much would performance be improved?  A quick and dirty test
suggests a couple of seconds for several thousand records; this was
a substantial fraction of the time to read the file, but may be less
significant when processing time is considered.
