gx-map bug 0088
Date: Wed 2006-04-19
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: Don't use clear-text password in tgcdb.conf

Summary:
The TeraGrid-specific version of gx-propagate depends on the
etc/gx-map/tgcdb.conf file to obtain information about how to connect
to the database.  This information includes a clear-text password.
An attacker who obtained a copy of that file would be able to make
modifications to the TGCDB.

For now, the file is required to have permissions 400 or 600 (though
the check is done too late), but I'd prefer to use a more secure
mechanism.

The problem is that this requires getting authentication information
into the gx-propagate command, which is invoked by gx-propagate,
which is executed by a cron job.  No good solution springs to mind.
