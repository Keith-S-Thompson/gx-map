gx-map bug 0160
Date: Thu 2007-09-06
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Consider using CoralCDN

Consider using the Coral Content Distribution Network to download
files.  This would be done in the GX::Cache_File routine.

For any http URL (it doesn't work for https or ftp URLs),
if the download fails, try falling back to CoralCDN
<http://www.coralcdn.org/>.

Appending ".nyud.net" to the hostname portion of the URL goes through
the Coral CDN.

It might even be worthwhile (as an option) to try CoralCDN first.
Doing so would tend to keep the CoralCDN caches up to date with the
necessary files.
