gx-map bug 0062
Date: Wed 2006-01-18
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Open
Title: Interaction between gx-propagate and remote requests.log

Summary:
As of release 0.4.X, gx-map supported limited propagation
using requests.log files downloaded from remote servers.
The Gridmap_Valid_Mappings.pm module (removed in release 0.5.X)
theoretically allowed remapping of requests from other sites (differing
NAMESPACE), but this was never really used apart from some experimental
propagation from SDSC to NCSA.

SDSC currently uses gx-map 0.4.1, with DataStar and the IA-64
clusters reading the requests.log file from the reference systems
via ftp.sdsc.edu.  This provides propagation in one direction only;
requests entered on DataStar or the IA-64 cluster are not propagated
back to the reference systems.

When gx-map 0.5.1 is deployed, this mechanism will no longer
be used.  Instead, all systems will use a shared data directory
on /projects/misc/gx-map, which will be mounted on all systems.
(Previously, there was no such shared filesystem).

In addition, the new gx-propagate mechanism will be used to propagate
mappings into the TGCDB.  Because of a limitation in the available
forms of AMIE packets, this will require re-scanning the local
requests.log file to determine what information actually needs to
be propagated.

If a system uses gx-propagate *and* reads a remote requests.log
file, the remote file will not be re-scanned.  This could result in
inconsistencies (I haven't analyzed the possibilities).

Workaround: Don't use gx-propagate and remote log files together.

Consider removing or deprecating the ability to use remote log files,
or even log files other than the default one.
