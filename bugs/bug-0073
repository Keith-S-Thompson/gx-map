gx-map bug 0073
Date: Tue 2006-02-28
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d8
Status: Open
Title: Think about group ownership for data files

Summary:
The GX_MAP_OWNER and REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS configuration options
allow you to specify the owner and permissions of the requests.log
file.  By default, the file has permissions 444; it can be set to
440 or 400 if desired.  For mode 440, the group ownership will be
the default group for the GX_MAP_OWNER account.  Consider allowing an
optional group name to be specified (the GX_MAP_OWNER account would
have to be a member of that group).
