gx-map bug 0055
Date: Sun 2005-10-16
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a2
Status: Open
Title: Send an e-mail warning on failure to download a file

Summary:
Currently, gx-ca-update sends an e-mail warning when a CRL has passed
90% of its lifetime, and when it expires.  No warning is sent on a
download failure as long as the last downloaded CRL is ok.

Send an e-mail warning on a failure to download a CRL, even if the
last one is ok.  We need to avoid sending this warning repeatedly,
which may be trickier that for existing errors.  We might even consider
sending another e-mail message if the CRL becomes available.
