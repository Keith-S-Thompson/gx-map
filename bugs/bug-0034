gx-map bug 0034
Date: Sun 2005-06-26
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: Be smarter about reporting errors by e-mail

Summary:
The gx-ca-update command reports an error (in var/gx-ca-update.log and
by e-mail) when there's an error with a CA.  Most of these errors are
about a CRL that is about to expire, or has expired, or is unavailable.
The problem: it reports the same error every time it runs, causing
a flurry of e-mail messages (mostly to me).  gx-ca-update maintains
no memory between executions of what errors it has already reported.

Suggested solution:
Maintain a file in the var directory with a list of errors that have
already been reported.  For example, record that a given CRL expires
at a specified time, and don't re-send a message for the same failure.
Each entry would contain something like:
    The name of the file (as installed).
    The nature of the failure: about to expire, expired, unavailable.
    The expiration time.
When an error condition goes away or changes, remove the corresponding
entry.  This is specific to CRL errors; think about what's needed for
other kind of errors (though since certificates and signing_policy
files are generally only installed once, that probably doesn't matter).

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.64
gx-map  release 0.5.0a1

Error files are created in the var/reported-errors directory.
There is currently no mechanism to clean them up automatically.
