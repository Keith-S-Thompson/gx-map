gx-map bug 0071
Date: Tue 2006-02-21
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d6
Title: Spurious complaint about bad request.file

Summary:
gx-request creates a temporary file with a name of the form
*_request.tmp, then renames it by removing the ".tmp" suffix.
This was intended to prevent gx-check-requests from seeing
a partially constructed request file.

The problem: I recently changed gx-check-requests so it complains about
any file in the new-requests directory whose name doesn't end in
".request" (other than ".", "..", and ".update").  If gx-request
and gx-check-requests happen to be running simultaneously,
gx-check-requests can see and complain about the temporary file.
In the one case where I saw this symptom, gx-check-requests also
complained that it was unable to rename the file, presumably because
gx-request had already renamed it.

This bug was introduced in gx-check-requests.in 1.82, release 0.5.0d1.

Proposed fix: Ignore any file whose name ends in ".request.tmp", but
only if its modification time is within 60 seconds of the current time
(the timestamp check avoids a potential denial-of-service attack).

Fixed:
gx-check-requests.in 1.86
gx-map release 0.5.0d6
