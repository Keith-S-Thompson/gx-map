gx-map bug 0060
Date: Fri 2005-12-16
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0c1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0c2
Title: Add "-force" option for gx-gen-mapfile

Summary:
gx-gen-mapfile checks the modification times of its input and
output files, and doesn't update any file that doesn't appear to
need updating.  Add a "-force" option to force an update regardless
of any timestamps.

Fixed:
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.75
gx-map release 0.5.0c2
