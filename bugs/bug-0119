gx-map bug 0119
Date: Wed 2006-09-27
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2.008
Status: Open
Title: Add a gx-watch-locks command

See also bug-0065.

It's much too easy to miss a lock file that's been there for a
long time.  For example, I just removed a .gx-ca-update.lock that
had been there for nearly 5 days, causing several CRLs to expire on
production systems.

Some method of automatically removing stale locks would be great,
but it's hard to see how to do that safely.  Probably a lock should
be removed if predates the last boot time of the machine on which it
was created, but that's tricky, and it only solves part of the problem.

A command that fails due to an existing lock normally sends e-mail,
but that's easy to miss.

Create a new command, gx-watch-locks, that periodically checks for
lock files.  (This is reminiscent of the "globus-status" command from
the old globus-extras package.)  By default, it displays a list of
existing locks and their ages.  With a command-line option, it checks
periodically; on each iteration, it clears the screen and shows current
locks.  Locks newer than, say, 1 minute are (optioally?) ignored;
locks older than, say, 1 hour are highlighted.  Highlighting is
probably a ">>> " prefix on the line, though I suppose I could use
"tput" if I wanted to be fancy.
