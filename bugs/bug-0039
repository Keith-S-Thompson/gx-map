gx-map bug 0039
Date: Thu 2005-06-30
Severity: low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0b2
Title: Consider removing Gridmap_Valid_Mappings.pm

Summary:
The Gridmap_Valid_Mappings.pm module is intended to be customized so
that a site can set rules for rejecting certain mappings.  As far as I
know, nobody is using anything other than the default implementation.
Consider removing the module and incorporating the functionality of the
default implementation into gx-gen-mapfile.in and/or Gridmap_Utils.pm.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.112
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.71
install-gx-map.in 1.44
Gridmap_Valid_Mappings.pm.in 1.27 (removed)
gx-map 0.5.0b2
