gx-map bug 0124
Date: Tue 2006-11-14
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2.023
Status: Fixed 0.5.3
Title: gx-gen-mapfile: add -merge-before, -merge-after

Currently, the "-merge-file" option to gx-gen-mapfile treats mappings
from the external grid-mapfile as if they were submitted in the
past, so they'll be overridden by any conflicting mappings from
the requests.log file.  This is not always the desired behavior
(particularly at ANL, according to a recent e-mail discussion with
JP Navarro).

Drop the "-merge-file" option and replace it with new "-merge-before"
and "-merge-after" options.  The "-merge-before" option behaves like
the old "-merge-file" options, treating mappings as having timestamps
starting at 0 (1970-01-01).  The "-merge-after" option treats mappings
as having timestampts starting one hour after the current time (to
avoid any problems with clock skew).

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.257
Relnotes 1.30
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.91
gx-gen-mapfile.8.pod 1.9
gx-map release 0.5.3
