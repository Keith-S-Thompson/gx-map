gx-map bug 0031
Date: Thu 2005-06-23
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Open
Title: Clean up requests.log file

Summary:
The requests.log file grows every time a request is made.
gx-gen-mapfile traverses and processes the entire log whenever
it needs to update the grid-mapfile.  Over time, this can become
slower and slower, especially if there are any "remove-user" requests
(but the fix for bug-0030 should mitigate this).  Caltech's log is
currently nearly 4 megabytes, with 6426 requests; it's likely that
many of these are redundant.

Proposed solution:
I've already written a preliminary version of a tool, gx-cleanup-logs,
that comments out (or deletes) redundant requests.  It will need
to be updated to handle the new "replace" request (see bug-0030).
I also want to modify it so it retains comments.
