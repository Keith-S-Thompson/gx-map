gx-map bug 0083
Date: Mon 2006-04-17
Severity: low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: "make clean" doesn't delete gx-map-gridmap-utils.3

Summary:
Running "./configure-gx-map foo.conf" creates man pages from the *.pod
files in the doc directory.  "make clean" deletes most of the generated
man pages, but leaves one in place; "doc/gx-map-gridmap-utils.3".

The cause is a simple omission in cleanup-gx-map: the line
    for file in doc/*.[1578] ; do
needs to be
    for file in doc/*.[13578] ; do
