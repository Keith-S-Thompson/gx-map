gx-map bug 0122
Date: Thu 2006-11-09
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2.022
Status: Open
Title: Need to check for bad user names

The gx-request, gx-check-requests, and gx-gen-mapfile commands
do little or no checking for legal user names.  gx-gen-mapfile by
default includes only accounts that actually exist, but sufficiently
bizarre user names could cause other problems.  For example, a name
containing a newline, quotation mark, or '/' character could cause
internal errors, or even corrupt the requests.log file.

Figure out a reasonable set of characters that can be allowed in Unix
account names (at least upper and lower case letters, digits, '-',
'_', possibly others, but all-digits is forbidden), and enforce this
is gx-request, gx-check-requests, and gx-gen-mapfile.
