gx-map bug 0053
Date: Fri 2005-10-14
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a3
Title: Consider disallowing root as an administrator

Summary:
Running the gx-map cron jobs as root is unnecessary.  Apart from the
general principle of not doing anything as root that doesn't actually
*need* to be done as root, it can cause some problems.  See bug-0052
for a bug that's triggered by running gx-check-requests as root.
Also, NFS-mounted filesystems often don't allow root access (root is
reduced to "nobody").

The recommended practice is to set GLOBUS_ADMINS in the installation
config file to a single, non-root, non-personal account.  (Using
a personal account can cause problems if the owner leaves the
organization, since the account name is permanently recorded in the
requests.log file.)  The "globus" account is usually a good choice,
or you can use a special "gx-map" account.

Consider disallowing the use of "root" (or any account with UID 0)
as an administrator.  Check during installation: disallow root as a
member of GLOBUS_ADMINS, and don't allow root to run install-gx-map.
Check during execution of gx-check-requests: bail out with an error
message if running as root.

We could also do some checking that the installed files, at least
the data files, are owned by an admininistrative account.
