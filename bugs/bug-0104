gx-map bug 0104
Date: Wed 2006-07-26
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: Work around missing Time::HiRes module

The gx-map system currently depends on the Time::HiRes module.
It turns out that a number of Perl installations don't have this
module.

Consider allowing gx-map to work without Time::HiRes, in one of
two ways:

1. If Time::HiRes is not available, just use time() and append
   ".000000" to the result.  (This could cause ordering problems with
   things like gx-ingest.)

2. Install an external program that prints a high-resolution
   timestamp, and invoke it rather than computing it internally (see
   my gettimeofday.c).  This is likely to slow things down a bit,
   so it's preferred to have Time::HiRes installed.  (I've tested
   this with gx-map 0.5.2.1 on NCSA's Tungsten system.)
