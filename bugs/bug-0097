gx-map bug 0097
Date: Tue 2006-06-20
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1.018
Status: Fixed 0.5.1.019
Title: Catching DB errors in gx-db-check-requests, gx-db-dump

Summary:
In gx-db-check-requests and gx-db-dump, the result of DBI->connect()
is checked (and the program die()s if it fails), but other calls
(prepare(), execute(), disconnect()) are not checked.

In gx-propagate.in.teragrid, connect is called with RaiseError => 1,
which causes any error to trigger a die().  gx-db-check-requests and
gx-db-dump should do the same thing.

Also, gx-db-check-requests should die if the connection and query
are successful, but no mappings are returned; this is more likely to
be the result of an error (e.g., a misspelled resource name) than an
actual empty mappings table.

Fixed:
gx-db-check-requests.in 1.4
gx-db-dump.in 1.2
gx-map release 0.5.1.019
