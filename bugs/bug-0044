gx-map bug 0044
Date: Fri 2005-07-08
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed ?
Title: gx-request: Mis-ordered lines in interactive mode

Summary:
One of the prompts in "gx-request -interactive" is:

    You can specify the DN in one of several ways:
    (c) Certificate, extract from
    (f) File, extract from a specified certificate file
	    $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem
    (i) Input the DN directly
    (x) Exit
    How do you want to specify the DN? [cfix] 

The line following (f) should follow (c).

This bug occurs in 0.4.5, but not in 0.4.1 (need to find out which
release it first appeared in).

Correction: this bug does not occur in any released version of gx-map.
It was introduced in gx-request.in 1.6 and corrected in gx-request.in
1.14.  (Release 0.4.5 includes gx-request.in revision 1.1.)
