gx-map bug 0058
Date: Fri 2005-10-28
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a6
Title: gx-ca-update needs to set permissions on generated files

Summary:
gx-ca-update doesn't set permissions on generated files.  This is
more or less ok if the umask is sane, but under Cygwin the umask for
a cron job is 000, resulting in files with permissions 666 (rw-rw-rw-).

Proposed fix:
Add a "-permissions" option to gx-ca-update, similar to the existing
option for gx-gen-mapfile, defaulting to 444.  Make sure everything
works properly if a file already exists with permissions 444.
Note that this also guards against accidental modification by the
GX_MAP_OWNER.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update-in 1.68
gx-map release 0.5.0a6
