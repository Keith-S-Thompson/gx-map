gx-map bug 0064
Date: Fri 2006-01-20
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Open
Title: Feature: Require user to prove he owns a certificate

Summary:
Currently, the gx-map system allows a user to map any arbitrary DN to
his own Unix account name.  This isn't necessarily a security hole
as long as a user can't map his own DN to someone else's account,
but it could cause some problems.  For one, a user could map someone
else's DN to his own account; this could deny the victim access
to his own account (while simultaneously giving the victim access
to the attacker's account, so it's not a very effective attack).
For another, it could create problems for any software that treats
the grid-mapfile as a mapping from user names to DNs, rather than
just DNs to user names.

Consider requiring the user running gx-request to prove that he
owns, or at least can use, the certificate with the requested DN.
For example, require the user to specify a certificate file (or use
the default $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem) and prompt for its passphrase.

Since gx-request is not privileged, validation is non-trivial.
Presumably, once the user enters a passphrase, it could use the user's
certificate to cryptographically sign a file, storing the signed
file along with a copy of the certificate (*not* the private key)
in the request file.  gx-check-requests could then confirm that the
file in the request was actually signed by the certificate, and that
the certificate was signed by a recognized CA (so the system on which
gx-check-requests runs has to have its /etc/grid-security/certificates
directory set up properly).

A gx-map administrator could still request mappings without confirming
the certificate, as is done currently.

Obviously this requires more thought and work.
