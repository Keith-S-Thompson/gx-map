gx-map bug 0074
Date: Tue 2006-02-28
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d8
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d9
Title: Race condition in check for *.request.tmp files

Summary:
gx-request creates a *.request.tmp file, then immediately renames
it to *.request.  To fix bug-0071, gx-check-requests ignores any
*.request.tmp file whose timestamp is within 60 seconds of the
current time.  This fix created a race condition:

1. gx-request creates foo.request.tmp
2.			gx-check-requests sees foo.request.tmp
3. gx-request renames foo.request.tmp to foo.request
4.			gx-check-requests tries to stat foo.request.tmp
			to determine its timestamp.  When it fails,
			it treats it as an error.  It also attempts to
			rename the file (to move it into the bad-requests
			directory; when this fails, it writes an error
			message to stderr.

Proposed solution:
If stat() fails on a *.request.tmp file, ignore it.

Fixed:
gx-check-requests.in 1.88
gx-map release 0.5.0d9
