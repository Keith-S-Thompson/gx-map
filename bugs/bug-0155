gx-map bug 0155
Date: Sat 2007-05-26
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2p1
Status: Open
Title: gx-db-request, gx-db-check-requests don't normalize DNs

The gx-db-request command doesn't normalize DNs.  Instead, the raw DN
(presumably from the TGCDB) is stored in the db-request file.

The gx-db-check-requests command normalizes DNs, but only incompletely.
It filters them through the GT4_Subject function.  It should use
Normalize_DN instead.  (Trailing occurrences of /CN=proxy and
/CN=[0-9]+ are not deleted.)

This isn't a huge deal, since DNs are normalized by gx-request.
