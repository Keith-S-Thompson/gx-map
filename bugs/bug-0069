gx-map bug 0069
Date: Thu 2006-01-26
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d1
Title: More checking of DN syntax

Summary:
Examination of the Globus source file
gsi/gss_assist/source/gridmap.c indicates that the syntax
of a grid-mapfile isn't as well-defined as one might hope.
See <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4180>.

Aspects relevant to gx-map are:

The DN may contain backslash-escaped character sequences:

    \\ --> \
    \xff is interpreted as hexadecimal
    \? --> ? for any character '?' (including \" --> "

The grid-mapfile is read using fgets() with a 1024-byte buffer,
with no explicit provision for long lines.  A line longer than 1024
characters would be treated as two separate lines.

Suggested fix:
Disallow \ characters in DNs.  (Consider re-enabling them if there's
ever a decent specification of the syntax.)  Disallow DNs longer than,
say, 900 characters.  In gx-gen-mapfile, don't generate lines longer
than 1000 characters.

Fix summary:
Reject a DN for any of the following:

Length exceeds 900 characters.
Contains a '"' character.
Contains a '\' character.
Contains anything other than a 7-bit ASCII printing character (we
were already doing this).

We might need to relax some of these restrictions once a syntax
description is available.

Check DNs for validity in both gx-request and gx-check-requests.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.143
gx-check-requests.in 1.84
gx-request.in 1.38  1.39
gx-map release 0.5.0d1
