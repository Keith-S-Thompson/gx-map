gx-map bug 0078
Date: Thu 2006-03-09
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0e1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0e2
Title: More robust configuration

Summary:
On one system I've tried (BeleniX, an x86 Solaris live CD), the
"whoami" command doesn't exist.  The install-gx-map.in script depends
on this command to determine whether the installer is the configured
GX_MAP_OWNER.

That same system had Perl, but didn't have the pod2man command
installed.  The algorithm for finding the pod2man command is fairly
complex and may be error-prone even on systems that provide it.
If the pod2man command is missing, the installation fails.

Proposed solution:
If the "whoami" command doesn't exist, try "who am i", filtering
the output through sed (another dependency) to remove everything
after the first blank.  If that fails, look at $LOGNAME, then $USER
(potentially insecure, but that's ok; anyone wanting to bypass the
check could easily modify the install-gx-map script).

Create a new "doc" (or "pod"?) directory, and install the *.pod
files there directly.  If the pod2man command can't be found, print
a warning; create the man directory tree but don't populate it.

Fixed:
configure-gx-map 1.39
install-gx-map.in 1.55, 1.56
gx-map release 0.5.0e2
