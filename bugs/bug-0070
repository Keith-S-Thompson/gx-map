gx-map bug 0070
Date: Fri 2006-01-27
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d1
Title: gx-request "-force-dn" option is reversed

Summary:
The "-force-dn" option to gx-request is intended to disable some syntax
checking for DNs.  In fact, the checking is disabled by default, and
the "-force-dn" option enables it.  This logic error was introduced
in gx-request.in revision 1.12, when it was modified to reject DNs
with control characters.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.143
gx-request.in 1.39
gx-map release 0.5.0d1
