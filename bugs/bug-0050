gx-map bug 0050
Date: Wed 2005-10-12
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a1
Status: Fixed ?
Title: Failure to install updated CRLs

Summary:
gx-ca-update checks the lastUpdate and nextUpdate fields of a newly
downloaded CRL.  Currently, if the new nextUpdate field precedes the
nextUpdate field of the previously cached copy. it doesn't install it.

This is incorrect behavior.  It's harmless as long as the lifetime
(nextUpdate - lastUpdate) is constant, but if the lifetime is shortened
it can prevent installation of newer CRLs, possibly allowing revoked
certificates to continue to be accepted.  For example, if a CRL's
lifetime is shortened from 14 days to 7 days no new CRLs will be
installed for a week after the change.

Fix:
gx-ca-update.in 1.66
gx-map release 0.5.0a2
