gx-map bug 0008
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Open
Title: "Newly downloaded CRL has expired" is misleading

Summary:
The gx-ca-update error message "Newly downloaded CRL has expired"
is potentially misleading.  The CRL in question may actually be a
previously cached one.

Suggested fix:
Update Gridmap_Utils::Cache_File so it returns, along with the name of
the cache file, an indication of whether it's newly downloaded or not.
Use this to make the error message clearer.

Partially fixed: gx-ca-update.in 1.64
The error message now says "CRL has expired".
It would still be good to specify whether the CRL was newly downloaded.
