gx-map bug 0008
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: "Newly downloaded CRL has expired" is misleading

Summary:
The gx-ca-update error message "Newly downloaded CRL has expired"
is potentially misleading.  The CRL in question may actually be a
previously cached one.

Suggested fix:
Update Gridmap_Utils::Cache_File so it returns, along with the name of
the cache file, an indication of whether it's newly downloaded or not.
Use this to make the error message clearer.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.64
gx-map release 0.5.0a1
The error message now says "CRL has expired".  If the download failed
and it's the cached CRL that has expired, there will be an additional
"curl failed" error message indicating this.
