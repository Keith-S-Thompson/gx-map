gx-map bug 0008
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Title: "Newly downloaded CRL has expired" is misleading

Summary:
The gx-ca-update error message "Newly downloaded CRL has expired"
is potentially misleading.  The CRL in question may actually be a
previously cached one.

Suggested fix:
Update Gridmap_Utils::Cache_File so it returns, along with the name of
the cache file, an indication of whether it's newly downloaded or not.
Use this to make the error message clearer.
