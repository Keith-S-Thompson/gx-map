gx-map bug 0011
Date: Sun 2005-03-27
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a3
Title: Refactor GLOBUS_ADMINS

Summary:
Currently, GLOBUS_ADMINS is a list of 1 or more user names.
The account that owns the installation and runs gx-check-requests and
gx-gen-mapfile is not distinguished.  This is fine if (as recommended)
it's the single user "globus", but confusing otherwise.

Suggested fix:
Delete GLOBUS_ADMINS.
Add GX_MAP_OWNER, the owner of the installation.
Add an optional ADDITIONAL_ADMINS; the old GLOBUS_ADMINS corresponds
the union of GX_MAP_OWNER and ADDITIONAL_ADMINS.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.100
configure-gx-map 1.31
sample.conf 1.19
gx-map release 0.5.0a3
