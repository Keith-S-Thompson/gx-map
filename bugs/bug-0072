gx-map bug 0072
Date: Thu 2006-02-23
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d7
Status: Open
Title: Possible loss of e-mail messages

Summary:
The gx-ca-update and gx-check-requests commands sometimes attempt to
send e-mail messages for significant error conditions.  This is done
using the Gridmap_Utils::Send_Email function, which attempts to use
"mailx" if it exists, falling back to "mail".  E-mail delivery is
generally not 100% reliable, and some systems aren't able to send
e-mail.  Most of the errors that trigger e-mail messages are logged
anyway, but it can be difficult to find them among the bulk of less
severe messages.

Proposed fix:
Log all e-mail messages to a file in the data directory.  To avoid
collisions, use a separate log for each program.
