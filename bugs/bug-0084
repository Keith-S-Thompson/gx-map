gx-map bug 0084
Date: Mon 2006-04-17
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: tgcdb.conf: check mode, install in right directory, document

Summary:
The tgcdb.conf file is used by gx-propagate.teragrid.  It specifies
information needed to access the database.

There are several problems with the way this is handled.

1. The file should have permissions 600 or 400, since it contains a
   clear-text password.  This is not checked.  (By the time it can be
   checked, it would be too late, but it's better than not checking
   at all.)

   (It would be nice to use something other than a clear-text password,
   but I don't know how else it could be done.)

2. gx-propagate looks for the tgcdb.conf file in the wrong directory.
   It looks in etc rather than etc/gx-map.  When I moved everything
   in etc into etc/gx-map (see bug-0054), I missed tgcdb.conf.

3. The format of the tgcdb.conf file is not adequately documented.
   Add a sample to README.TeraGrid, and consider either adding a man
   page or adding the information to the gx-propagate(8) man page.
