Date: Thu 2007-02-22
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Stale cache files

An error occurred in gx-map 0.5.3.2 gx-ca-update, in Cache_File,
attempting to create a hard link with what should have been a unique
name.  The e-mail notification follows:

================================

Examination of the cache directory shows 68 stale cache files as
of Thu 2007-02-22.  One was created on rojo.sdsc.edu on 2006-12-15.
The others were all created on lctb1.sdsc.edu on 2007-02-13 through
2007-02-15.  The names are made unique by appending the hostname and
PID; the error occurred when gx-ca-update ran with the same PID.
All the stale files were copies of one of three different CRLs:
    http=3A=2F=2Fca.ncsa.uiuc.edu=2F4a6cd8b1.r0
    http=3A=2F=2Fcertificate.nikhef.nl=2Fmedium=2Fcacrl.pem
    http=3A=2F=2Fwww.sdsc.edu=2FCA=2F3deda549.r0

This must have been caused by gx-ca-update calling Cache_File without
calling Release_Cache_File.  This can happen if the gx-ca-update
process is killed without having a chance to perform cleanup.

The error occurs on a call to the built-in "link" function in
Make_Hard_Link.  One solution would be to unlink the target file before
invoking "link"; this would avoid the error, but wouldn't prevent the
accumulation of stale files.  In addition, it probably makes sense to
use Register_Handler_Function to arrange for Die_Handler to release any
active cache files -- but since I received no e-mail for the original
error that created the stale cache files, it seems that gx-ca-update
was killed without having a chance to invoke the Die_Handler.
