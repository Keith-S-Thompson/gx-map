gx-map bug 0023
Date: Fri 2005-04-29
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.3
Status: Fixed ?
Title: Allow version param in config file

Summary:
The distributed sample.conf file has the following lines:

INSTALL_DIR     /INSTALL/DIR/gx-map-0.4.3
DATA_DIR        /DATA/DIR/gx-map-0.4.3-data

These have to be updated for each release.

Provide a mechanism to include the current version number in the
INSTALL_DIR or DATA_DIR, and use this in sample.conf.  (Update later
for the new configuration mechanism.)

Syntax:

INSTALL_DIR     /INSTALL/DIR/gx-map-%VERSION%
DATA_DIR        /DATA/DIR/gx-map-%VERSION%-data

Fixed:
configure-gx-map 1.27, gx-map ?
