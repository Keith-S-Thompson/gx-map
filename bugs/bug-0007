gx-map bug 0007
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Open
Title: New configuration system

Summary:
New configuration system.

This is currently a work in progress.

Rather than requiring the installer to write a configuration file
to drive the installation, use a configure/make/make install setup.
The --prefix must be specified (there is no default); most other
options may be omitted.  A run-time configuration file is created,
and all commands read this file (and have an option to specify a
different configuration file).

If enough information is provided to configure, the installation will
be complete.  If not, certain fields are left blank, and any attempt
to read the configuration file will cause the command to die with a
message indicating that it needs to be updated.  Consider providing
a gx-config command that displays and/or updates the current
configuration (and tracks changes in RCS, perhaps).

As part of this work, we need to be able to install gx-map into an
existing directory tree.  gx-map 0.4.5 is included in the NMI 7.0
release, but is not integrated into the build system; the tarball
is included in the tools directory.  Probably most of the files in
gx-map's etc subdirectory should be installed in etc/gx-map (we don't
want to install the gx-map README file as $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/README).
Consider moving the stuff in lib into lib/gx-map as well.
The executable scripts in bin and sbin should be ok.

Motivation: Simplify installation and make it work better with a
future NMI release.

See also "new-config" in the gx-map CVS directory.

Proposed first step: Leave the configuration and installation method
as it is, but read the configuration from the config file at run time,
allowing changes in *some* options to be made by editing the file.
