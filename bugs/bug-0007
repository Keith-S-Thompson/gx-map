gx-map bug 0007
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1

Summary:
New configuration system.

This is currently a work in progress.

Rather than requiring the installer to write a configuration file
to drive the installation, use a configure/make/make install setup.
The --prefix must be specified (there is no default); most other
options may be omitted.  A run-time configuration file is created,
and all commands read this file (and have an option to specify a
different configuration file).

If enough information is provided to configure, the installation will
be complete.  If not, certain fields are left blank, and any attempt
to read the configuration file will cause the command to die with a
message indicating that it needs to be updated.  Consider providing
a gx-config command that displays and/or updates the current
configuration (and tracks changes in RCS, perhaps).

Motivation: Simplify installation and make it work better with a
future NMI release.

See also "new-config" in the gx-map CVS directory.
