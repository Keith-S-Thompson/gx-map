gx-map bug 0077
Date: Thu 2006-03-02
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d9
Status: Open
Title: Unknown error, Cache_File temporary directory

Summary:
I've seen this error once on tg-login1.sdsc.teragrid.org running
gx-ca-update, gx-map release 0.5.0d9:

/users/globus/local/apps/gx-map-0.5.0d9/var/cache/tmp-1141331847-10973: File exists
Traceback:
    /users/globus/local/apps/gx-map-0.5.0d9/lib/Gridmap_Utils.pm:1495 in Gridmap_Utils::Cache_File
    /users/globus/local/apps/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-ca-update:964 in main::Update_And_Install_CRL
    /users/globus/local/apps/gx-map-0.5.0d9/sbin/gx-ca-update:357

It appears that the problem occurred because a previous call
to Cache_File in the same invocation of the gx-ca-update program
failed to remove the temporary directory.  As far as I can tell,
the Cache_File function should always remove the temporary directory
(i.e., this shouldn't happen), but the rmdir calls aren't checked.

Proposed action:
Watch for this error to occur again.  Add error checking on unlink and
rmdir calls in Cache_File function so the error can be caught sooner.
Possible kludge: use a different name for the temporary directory
on each call to Cache_File so this won't crash the program if it
occurs again.
