gx-map bug 0135
Date: Fri 2007-02-09
Severity: Urgent
Reported by: Benjamin Bennett <ben@psc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.3.3
Title: Race condition in gx-check-requests

See e-mail exchange with ben@psc.edu starting Fri 2007-02-09.

An exploit was demonstrated.

Also, the ".update" file in the new-requests directory is owned by
the gx-map owner and has world write permissions.  An attacker could
very easily write a bogus request to the ".update" file (which would
not change its ownership), then create a symlink or hard link to it
with a name that looks like a valid request file.  This bug does not
involve a race condition, and is very easy to exploit if you know
what you're doing.

Release 0.5.3.3 corrects this by being more careful about reading
request files, and by eliminating the "gx-request -update" option
and the ".update" file.

As a result of this bug and bug-0136, release 0.5.3.2 and all earlier
releases are now unsupportd; all users should upgrade to 0.5.3.2p1
or 0.5.3.3.

Fixed:
gx-map release 0.5.3.3
