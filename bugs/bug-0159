gx-map bug 0159
Date: Fri 2007-07-06
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Don't use $^S in __DIE__ handler

"perldoc perlvar" says:

    Having to even think about the $^S variable in your exception handlers
    is simply wrong.  $SIG{__DIE__} as currently implemented invites
    grievous and difficult to track down errors.  Avoid it and use an
    "END{}" or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.

Do this.
