gx-map bug 0146
Date: Wed 2007-04-25
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Bugs in "gx-request -interactive"

The "gx-request -interactive" command fails in some cases.  An attempt
to do a "remove" or "remove-dn" results in a fatal error message,
either "No DN specified" or "No username specified", though it hasn't
prompted for the required information.
