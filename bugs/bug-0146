gx-map bug 0146
Date: Wed 2007-04-25
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Fixed 0.5.9.007
Title: Bugs in "gx-request -interactive"

The "gx-request -interactive" command fails in some cases.  An attempt
to do a "remove", "remove-dn", or "remove-user" results in a fatal
error message, either "No DN specified" or "No username specified",
though it hasn't prompted for the required information.

This bug was introduced in release 0.5.3.3 as a side effect of removing
the "-update" option.

Fixed:
gx-request.in 1.78
gx-map release 0.5.9.007
