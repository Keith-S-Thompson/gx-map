gx-map bug 0152
Date: Thu 2007-05-24
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Huge number of files in data directories

Each submitted request is moved, after it's processed, from the
"new-requests" directory into the "good-requests" directory.

Each submitted TGCDB request is moved, after it's processed, from the
"new-db-requests" directory into the "old-db-requests" directory.

As a result, the number of files in each of these directories can
increase without bound over time.  I've seen over 12,000 files in a
single directory on one system, and over 70,000 on another.

It's not clear whether this is an actual problem.  If it is, a
solution is to create a directory tree, by year, then by month, and
then by date, rather than putting all the files in a single directory.
For example, a processed request file that's currently moved to
    good-requests/1180060906.502531-uffda.sdsc.edu-kst-12272.request
might instead be moved to
    good-requests/2007/05/25/1180060906.502531-uffda.sdsc.edu-kst-12272.request
with the intermediate directories being created on the fly as needed.
(Note that the date is determined by UTC, not local time.)

Theoretically this could also be done for the bad-requests directory.
It may or may not be worth the effort.  (Actually, it might be simpler
just to do it consistently.)
