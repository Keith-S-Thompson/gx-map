gx-map bug 0087
Date: Wed 2006-04-19
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Fixed 0.5.2
Title: AMIE doesn't handle removals?

Summary:
According to a recent e-mail from Michael Shapiro
<mshapiro@ncsa.uiuc.edu>, the TGCDB will no longer handle removals
of mappings, only additions.  More information is needed.

If this is the case, changes will have to be made in
gx-propagate.in.teragrid so that remove requests are ignored; this
should be simple as updating the TGCDB package (code recently provided
by mshapiro) and stubbing out the Remove_Mapping function.

Supposedly AMIE packets should be handled by adding all the specified
DNs without removing any.  The new AMIE handling mechanism suggested
in bug-0086 should handle this; it just means that nothing will be
removed from the index file.

Fixed:
gx-map release 0.5.2

The TGCDB now handles removals.
