gx-map bug 0148
Date: Fri 2007-04-27
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Extraneous username field

At NCSA and TACC, several records have shown up in the errors.log file.
Here's a sample from TACC:

{
	ERRORS             Extraneous username field
	NAMESPACE          TACC
	OWNER_NAME         globust
	OWNER_UID          29611
	PROCESSED          1168019857.775447 Fri 2007-01-05 17:57:37 UTC
	REQUEST_FILE       1168019730.501611-lonestar2.ls.tacc.utexas.edu-globust-23318.request
	SOURCE             admin
	dn                 "/C=US/O=UTAustin/OU=TACC/CN=David M Carver/UID=dcarver"
	hostname           lonestar2.ls.tacc.utexas.edu
	operation          remove-dn
	requested_by_name  globust
	requested_by_uid   29611
	timestamp          1168019730.501611 Fri 2007-01-05 17:55:30 UTC
	username           globust
}

The "username" field should never be set for a remove-dn operation.
I haven't yet figured out how this can happen.  (Of course, a bogus
gx-request command or manual editing of the request file could cause
this, but that's unlikely, especially since it's happened several
times at two sites.)
