gx-map bug 0020
Date: Thu 2005-04-21
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.2
Status: Fixed 0.4.4, 0.5.0a9
Title: Work around web server problem for DOEGrids CA CRL

Summary:
The CRL for the DOEGrids CA is available at
<http://pki1.doegrids.org/CRL/1c3f2ca8.r0>.  The web server doesn't
seem to support the http "HEAD" command, which is used by "wget
--timestamping"; this interferes with the caching mechanism used by the
gx-map system (particularly, in this case, the gx-ca-update command).
The file is successfully downloaded the first time, but further
attempts to download it will fail, leaving the old copy in place.
The CRL is updated regularly, but gx-ca-update doesn't grab the
new version.

I sent e-mail about this problem to <trouble@es.net> on Tue 2004-12-28.
They opened ESnet ticket TTS#12790.  They told me on Thu 2005-02-03
that it would take at least 3 months to fix the problem.

The workaround is to periodically delete the 1c3f2ca8.r0 file from
the gx-map cache.

Suggested fix: Add an attribute to 1c3f2ca8.doegrids.cadesc indicating
that the cached CRL needs to be deleted before grabbing a new copy.

Suggested fix: Rather than using "wget --timestamping", use some
other magic to invoke the http "HEAD" command (ick).

Suggested fix: Add an argument to Cache_File indicating that the
file is expected to be small.  Use this argument for certificates
and CRLs.  If this is set, don't cache (or nuke the cached copy
before downloading).

Suggested fix: Just wait for the ESnet folks to fix their server.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.64
gx-ca-update.in 1.56
ca/1c3f2ca8.doegrids.cadesc 1.14
gx-map release 0.4.4
Add a new CRL_DOWNLOAD_GLITCH attribute.
If set, rename the existing cached file before attempting to download
a new one.
The eventual fix for bug-0022 should supersede this workaround.

New fix:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.107
gx-ca-update.in 1.74
ca/1c3f2ca8.doegrids.cadesc 1.15
gx-map release 0.5.0a9
Implemented fix for bug-0022 (new cache mechanism).
Dropped CRL_DOWNLOAD_GLITCH attribute (no longer needed).
Note that the special treatment for small files has not been
implemented.
