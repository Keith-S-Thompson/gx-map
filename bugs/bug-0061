gx-map bug 0061
Date: Fri 2005-12-30
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0c7
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update won't install cert if CRL is about to expire

Summary:
gx-ca-update generates an error message if a CRL is about to expire
(i.e., if it's used more than 90% of its lifetime).  On an initial
run, when first installing files, this prevents it from installing
the certificate.

A CRL that's about to expire should be treated as a warning, not as
an error.
