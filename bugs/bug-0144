gx-map bug 0144
Date: Wed 2007-04-04
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Consider supporting deferred propagation

See the e-mail discussion with Michael Shapiro, Wed 2007-04-04.

A new SDSC staff member ran the gx-request command, but the TGCDB
did not yet know about his account on any SDSC resource, apparently
because SDSC hadn't responded to the AMIE packet requesting the
account creation.  But he had had a Unix account for some time
(obviously, since he was able to run gx-request).

So the gx-propagate command failed, because it was unable to determine
a resource name for the user (required for the gxmap.add_dn()
function).  However, gx-map worked properly within SDSC, and his DN
is in the grid-mapfile on all SDSC systems.

Given the current setup, the solution will be to wait for the account
information to be added to the TGCDB, then re-submit the mapping
request via gx-request (either the user or an administrator can
do this).

If this kind of problem is going to be rare, that's probably good
enough.  If it's going to be common, though, an automated solution
would be a good thing.

A vague outline of a possible solution:

gx-propagate attempts to submit a request by invoking gxmap.add_dn()
or gxmap.remove_dn().  If it succeeds, we're done.  If it fails,
particularly because it can't determine the resource name (i.e.,
the user doesn't have an account), and *maybe* for any other reasons
(say, the DB server is temporarily down), it records the transaction
somewhere, and it becomes pending.  Periodically, perhaps once a
day, another process attempts to resubmit any pending transactions.
In other words, we'd have yet another directory full of request files
waiting to be processed.

Another possibility is, if a resource name can't be determined,
to submit the mapping with *each* resource matching the wildcard
in tgcdb-db-config.  All these additions would be deferred within
the TGCDB until the account is added.
