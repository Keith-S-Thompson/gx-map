gx-map bug 0016
Date: Sun 2005-04-17
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Closed
Title: Don't fail if one grid-mapfile can't be written

Summary:
gx-gen-mapfile allows multiple output files to be written.  Currently,
it dies if it can't write one of them.  Instead, it should write as
many as it can (but collect the errors and print a warning).

This was motivated by an issue on Blue Horizon (writing to a local
filesystem and to /projects/globus, which wasn't always mounted).
Blue Horizon has since been shut down.  Even there, the problem
could be worked around by re-ordering the output files, specifying
/projects/globus last.

Closed:
As of release 0.5.3.3, gx-gen-mapfile can only write a single
grid-mapfile, so this problem can no longer occur.
