gx-map bug 0153
Date: Thu 2007-05-24
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2p1
Status: Open
Title: DB request files not moved

On TACC's Maverick and Lonestar systems, db-request files are not
being moved from the new-db-requests directory to the old-db-requests
directory, though it appears they are being processed (the
tgcdb-mappings files is up to date).

I don't know why this would be happening.  The directory permissions
look ok.  Probably any errors would result in e-mail, either to
the ADMIN_EMAIL address or to the owner of the relevant cron job.
Perhaps something is dying (without leaving a lock file) after the
request is processed but before the files are moved?

The effect is likely to be that each run of gx-db-check-requests will
have to reexamine all 72,000+ files.
