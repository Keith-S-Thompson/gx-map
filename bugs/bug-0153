gx-map bug 0153
Date: Thu 2007-05-24
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2p1
Status: Open
Title: DB request files not moved

On TACC's Maverick and Lonestar systems, db-request files are not
being moved from the new-db-requests directory to the old-db-requests
directory, though it appears they are being processed (the
tgcdb-mappings files is up to date).

The effect is likely to be that each run of gx-db-check-requests will
have to reexamine all 72,000+ files.  If any one of those files is
a full-request, all others will be effectively ignored.

On further investigation, the problem is that the Cleanup routine is
not called consistently.  Cleanup is the only place where db-request
files are moved to the old-db-requests directory, and it's only called
if there were no request files (in which case there's nothing for
it to do other than release the lock), or if there were no changes.

There needs to be a call to Cleanup() during normal termination,
after the requests have been submitted, in place of the existing call
to Release_Lock.

The likely result of this bug is that the new-requests directory will
*sometimes* not be cleaned up, and that requests will therefore be
re-processed the next time gx-db-check-requests runs -- but sooner or
later gx-db-requests will be run with one or more db-request files
that make no net changes to the tgcdb-mappings file, resulting in
a call to Cleanup().  At SDSC, this hasn't been a serious problem,
probably because we only submit full-query requests once an hour; many
or most of these probably don't result in any changes, which causes
Cleanup() to be called.
