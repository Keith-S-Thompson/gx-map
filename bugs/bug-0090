gx-map bug 0090
Date: Fri 2006-04-28
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: Translate "/E=" and "/EMAIL=" to "/emailAddress="

Summary:
The DN attribute currently called "emailAddress" was called "Email"
in GT2 and OpenSSL 0.9.6.  It turns out that "E" and "EMAIL" are
also valid names for this attribute; in GT3, the pre-WS tools expect
"/emailAddress=...", but the WS tools expect "/E=...".

The GT2_Subject function currently translates "/emailAddress=..."
to "/Email=..."; it should also translate both "/E=..." and
"/EMAIL=..."  to "/Email=...".

The GT4_Subject function currently translates "/Email=..."
to "/emailAddress=..."; it should also translate both "/E=..." and
"/EMAIL=..."  to "/emailAddress=...".

A new GT3_Subject function should translate all these forms to
"/E=..." (as well as doing the GT4-compatible translation for USERID
vs. UID).

A new command-line option for gx-gen-mapfile should generate DNs using
the GT3-compatible form.  (I don't expect this will be used very often,
since it applies *only* to GT3 WS code.)

A similar command-line option for gx-ca-update should do the same
thing for signing_policy files.
