gx-map bug 0041
Date: Sun 2005-07-03
Severity: low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Closed
Title: Investigate behavior on AFS

Summary:
AFS does some strange things with permissions (for example, IIRC,
permissions apply to directories but not to individual files).  Look
into how this might affect a gx-map data directory.  If necessary,
either modify gx-map to work properly under AFS or detect AFS and
refuse to run.

Later: An experiment on north.cs.wisc.edu gives an error during
installation:

chmod: changing permissions of `/u/k/t/kthompso/local/var/gx-map-0.4.5a-data/new-requests' (requested: 1733, actual: 0733): Operation not permitted

If the gx-map data directory can't be installed under AFS, it looks
like there isn't a real problem.  (It is possible to install gx-map
under AFS, and put the data directory on a non-AFS partition; there
shouldn't be any problem with that.)

I think the only remaining issue here is making it possible to put
the data directory on an AFS filesystem.  Unless there's some interest
in doing this, I'm going to close this bug.
