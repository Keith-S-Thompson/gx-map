gx-map bug 0123
Date: Thu 2006-11-09
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2.022
Status: Fixed 0.5.3
Title: Cleanup Get_PW, Get_GR, Get_Groups functions

These are all functions in the Gridmap_Utils package.

The Get_PW function is more flexible than it needs to be, leading
to potential errors.  With no arguments, it calls getpwent (I don't
think this is ever used).  With one argument, it calls either getpwuid
or getpwnam, depending on whether its argument is numeric.  In all
cases, the caller already knows this.  Confirm this, then drop the
getpwent functionality and split Get_PW into separate Get_PW_UID and
Get_PW_Name functions.

The Get_GR function is analagous to Get_PW, but for groups.
It's called only from Get_Groups.  The Get_Groups function itself is
never used.  Confirm this, then delete both functions.

Update gx-util-test.in to reflect these changes.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.252
gx-check-requests.in 1.99
gx-convert-log.in 1.32
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.90
gx-request.in 1.61
gx-util-test.in 1.8
gx-map release 0.5.3
