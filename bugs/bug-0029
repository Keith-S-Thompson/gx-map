gx-map bug 0028
Date: Mon 2005-06-20
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: Re-think secondary mappings

Summary:
Secondary mappings are an indirect kludge to support mapping multiple
user names.  The division of mappings into primary and secondary,
with primary mappings overriding previous primary mappings but
secondary mappings accumulating, is arbitrary.  As far as I can tell,
the feature has never been used deliberately (though it has caused
problems when users use it incorrectly).

Suggested fix:
Re-think ways to support mapping a DN to multiple user names.
Possibilities:

1. Make it a single request.  Only an administrator can add or remove
a multi-user mapping (since it gives access to both accounts).
An administrator can request a DN to be mapped to "foo,bar"; this
overrides any previous mappings for the same DN.

2. Drop the concept of secondary mappings.  All mappings are primary,
and they accumulate; if a DN is mapped to "foo" and then to "bar",
then it will appear in the grid-mapfile as "foo,bar".  Ordering is
determined by the order in which the requests are made; the most
recent mapping is first.  (To swap the order, remove and re-add the
older mapping.)

This may involve the "secondary" attribute going away.  We can either
allow and ignore it, or eliminate it altogether.  In the latter case,
we should update the release version to 0.5.X, since it requires a
requests.log conversion.

Fix:
The "secondary" attribute has been removed and is no longer recognized
(except by gx-convert-log).  See also bug-0028.

Fixed:
Multiple files.
