gx-map bug 0006
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Title: Use SHA1 fingerprints in gx-ca-update

Summary:
In gx-ca-update, migrate from MD5 to SHA1 fingerprints.

Currently, each *.cadesc file has an MD5_FINGERPRINT attribute.
The downloaded certificate is checked against this using
    openssl x509 -fingerprint -x509

The MD5 algorithm has been partially broken.  OpenSSL also supports the
SHA1 algorithm, which has also been partially broken but still appears
to be stronger than MD5.  (Stronger, and so far unbroken, algorithms
like SHA256 are available, but OpenSSL doesn't (yet?) support them.)

Add an *optional* SHA1_FINGERPRINT attribute to the *.cadesc
files.  Add this for any CAs for which I'm able to obtain a copy
of the certificate.  In gx-ca-update, if both MD5_FINGERPRINT and
SHA1_FINGERPRINT are specified, check them both; otherwise just check
MD5_FINGERPRINT (which will still be mandatory).
