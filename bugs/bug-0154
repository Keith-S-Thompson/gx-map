gx-map bug 0154
Date: Fri 2007-05-25
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2p1
Status: Fixed 0.5.9.011
Title: gx-propagate fails for "-remove-user", "-remove-dn"

gx-propagate with the "-remove-user" option failed with the following
(from gx-propagate.log):

Fri 2007-05-25 20:05:05 UTC
gx-propagate -source admin -remove-user -username [deleted]
Internal error, $kind = "log"

The problem is a typo in the Gen_Mappings function in
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in (now GX.pm.in).  The $kind variable is set based on
an argument to either "-log", "-gridmap-before", or "-gridmap-after".
The intended default, if none of these options is specified, is
"-log", but it's set to "log", resulting in the above error.

This will affect both "-remove-user" and "-remove-dn".

Solution: Default $kind to "-log", not "log".

Fixed:
GX.pm.in 1.47
gx-map release 0.5.9.011
