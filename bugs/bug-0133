gx-map bug 0133
Date: Wed 2007-02-07
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Rename Gridmap_Utils package to GX

The Gridmap_Utils package's name doesn't really reflect
its full purpose, since gx-map is no longer just for
maintaining grid-mapfiles.  Rename it to GX.  Do a massive
search-and-destroy^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H-replace to update all references.
This also has the advantage of being shorter, avoiding overly long
source lines.
