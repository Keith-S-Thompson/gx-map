gx-map bug 0133
Date: Wed 2007-02-07
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Rename Gridmap_Utils package to GX_Lib

The Gridmap_Utils package's name doesn't really reflect its
full purpose, since gx-map is no longer just for maintaining
grid-mapfiles.  Rename it to GX_Lib.  Do a massive
search-and-destroy^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H-replace to update all references.
This also has the advantage of being shorter.  Hmm, should I call
it GX?
