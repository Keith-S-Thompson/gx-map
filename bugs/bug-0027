gx-map bug 0027
Date: Thu 2005-06-16
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed ?
Title: Add -ca-list option to gx-ca-update

Summary:
The list of CAs to be accepted has to be passed explicitly to
gx-ca-update.  This requires updating the cron job whenever this list
needs to be updated.  Cron jobs are often maintained manually, so this
could be error-prone.  It also makes a "crontab -l" listing very long.

Suggested fix:
Add a -ca-list option.  The argument is a file containing a list of
CAs, one per line, specified in the same form as the argument to the
existing -ca option.  Allow comments in the file.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.64, gx-map ?
