gx-map bug 0054
Date: Sat 2005-10-15
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a2
Status: Open
Title: Ensure gx-map can be installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION

Summary:
See also bug-0007, New configuration system.

Make sure that gx-map can be installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION.

All file names must be distinct.  Look into the relationship between
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var and the gx-map var directory.

A quick experiment indicates that it mostly works, but some problems
may remain.
