gx-map bug 0054
Date: Sat 2005-10-15
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a2
Status: Fixed, 0.5.0e7
Title: Ensure gx-map can be installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION

Summary:
See also bug-0007, New configuration system.

Make sure that gx-map can be installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION.

All file names must be distinct.  Look into the relationship between
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var and the gx-map var directory.

A quick experiment indicates that it mostly works, but some problems
may remain.

Possible conflicts:
    Several files in etc (create etc/gx-map?)
    The var directory (rename to gx-map-data?)

Everything else look ok (bin, doc, lib, man, sbin).

Or just require gx-map to be installed in its own directory, possibly
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/gx-map-<version>.

Fix:
Rename "etc" to "etc/gx-map".
Rename "var" to "gx-map-data".
All installed files are now vanishingly unlikely to conflict with
anything else.
(Of course, gx-map can still be installed in its own directory if
desired.)
