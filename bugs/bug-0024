gx-map bug 0024
Date: Fri 2005-05-06
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.3
Title: Don't assume Perl's getpw* functions return 9 elements

Summary:
The Gridmap_Utils::Get_PW function returns undef if getpwuid or
getpwnam doesn't return a list of exactly 9 items.  On some systems,
for some versions of Perl, these functions can return a 10-item list;
the optional 10th item is called $expire.  This shows up on MacOS X
with Perl 5.8.1-RC3.  The symptom (in release 0.4.3) is:

Use of uninitialized value in numeric ne (!=) at /Users/kst/apps/gx-map-0.4.3/bin/gx-map line 156.
Traceback:
    /Users/kst/apps/gx-map-0.4.3/bin/gx-map:156

Suggested fix:
Require getpw* to return at least 9 elements, not exactly 9 elements.
If a 10th elements is present, assign it to the result under the key
"expire".  Similarly, allow more than 4 elements for getgrnam and
getgrgid; it never returns more than 4 as far as I know, but it won't
hurt to loosen the check a little.
