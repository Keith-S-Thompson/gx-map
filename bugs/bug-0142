gx-map bug 0142
Date: Tue 2007-03-27
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.9.030
Title: Clean up cadesc files for expired CAs

When installing cadesc files, move files for expired CAs to an
"expired" subdirectory (check the CERT_EXPIRES attribute against the
current date during installation).  This isn't a big deal functionally,
it just avoids clutter.  It also makes it impossible to install an
expired CA certificate, which is not a bad thing.

Fixed:
gx-install-cadesc.in 1.15
gx-map release 0.5.9.030
