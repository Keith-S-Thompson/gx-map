gx-map bug 0051
Date: Thu 2005-10-13
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a1
Status: Open
Title: Potentially long command lines for gx-request -set

Summary:
The gx-request command can now accept arbitrarily many DNs as
command-line arguments with the "-set" option.  On some systems,
this might overflow the maximum command line length, either of the
OS or of the shell.  I don't think this is likely on modern systems,
but it's worth providing an alternative.
