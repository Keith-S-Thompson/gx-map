gx-map bug 0042
Date: Thu 2005-07-07
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: gx-request allows malformed DNs

Summary:
The gx-request command (formerly gx-map) allows malformed DNs,
particularly DNs containing newline characters.  This could create a
malformed request file, and could conceivably corrupt the requests.log
file, though it's more likely to cause the request file to be rejected
by gx-check-requests.

It's possible that this could be a security hole, though I haven't
thought of a way to exploit it.

(If this were a security hole, it would be the fault of
gx-check-requests, which must behave safely even if the request file
is forged.)

Fixed:
gx-request.in 1.12
gx-map release 0.5.0a1
