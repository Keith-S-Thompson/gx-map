gx-map bug 0105
Date: Mon 2006-07-31
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update logging is not checked

The Notify function in gx-ca-update appends a message to a log file
using open, print, and close.  It doesn't check whether these
succeeded.

Similar code in gx-map 0.4.1 has produced the following error message:

print() on closed filehandle LOG at /usr/local/apps/gx-map-0.4.1/sbin/gx-ca-update line 1161.

This function should check the results of all three calls, and print
a coherent message to stderr if any of them fails.
