gx-map bug 0158
Date: Wed 2007-06-27
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Add "-immediate" option to gx-db-request

The need to run both gx-db-request and gx-db-check-requests can
be confusing, especially when gx-db-request is only run with the
"-full-request" option.

Add a "-immediate" option to gx-db-request.  This simply causes it
to invoke gx-db-check-requests before terminating.

So rather than periodically running
    gx-db-request -full-request
    gx-db-check-requests
a site can run run
    gx-db-request -full-request -immediate
and the gx-db-check-requests comand doesn't need to be invoked
explicitly at all.

Sites that invoke "gx-db-request -add" or "gx-db-request -remove"
in response to incoming AMIE packets would not use the "-immediate"
option.
