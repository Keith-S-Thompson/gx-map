gx-map bug 0158
Date: Wed 2007-06-27
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Add "-full-query" option to gx-db-check-requests

The need to run both gx-db-request and gx-db-check-requests can
be confusing, especially when gx-db-request is only run with the
"-full-query" option.

Add a "-full-query" option to gx-db-check-requests.  This causes it
to assume a single "full-query" request; it will also (as usual)
process and ignore all existing db-request files moving them from
old-requests to new-requests.

So rather than periodically running
    gx-db-request -full-query
    gx-db-check-requests
a site can run run
    gx-db-check-requests -full-query
and the gx-db-requests comand doesn't need to be invoked at all.

Sites that invoke "gx-db-request -add" or "gx-db-request -remove"
in response to incoming AMIE packets would not use this new option,
except perhaps for a periodic full-query used to ensure that everything
remains synchronized.

(An alternative is to add a "-immediate" option to gx-db-requests,
causing it to invoke gx-db-check-requests.  That was my first idea,
but I like the "gx-db-check-requests -full-query" idea better.)

Fixed:
gx-db-check-requests.in 1.19
gx-map release 0.5.9.017
