gx-map bug 0009
Date: Sat 2005-03-26
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Fixed 0.4.2
Title: Better tracebacks on errors

Summary:
Error messages from die() include the line number on which die()
was invoked, but not where it was called from.  This can make things
difficult to track down (for example, a number of functions in
Gridmap_Utils die on failure.

Suggested fix:
Add the Die_Handler and Register_Handler_Function functions
from die_handler_demo to Gridmap_Utils, and let all
programs set $SIG{__DIE__} to \&Gridmap_Utils::Die_Handler.
Register_Handler_Function is for use in gx-gen-mapfile, to register
a function to delete the temp file:

    my $tmp_file = "/tmp/gx-gen-mapfile-" . time . "-$$";

    $SIG{__DIE__} = \&Gridmap_Utils::Die_Handler;
    Gridmap_Utils::Register_Die_Function sub { unlink $tmp_file };

This is largely implemented.

Alternative: Use the Carp module instead (needs study).

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.59
gx-check-requests.in 1.41
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.46
gx-map.in 1.41
gx-map release 0.4.2
