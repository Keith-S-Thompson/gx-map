gx-map bug 0114
Date: Sat 2006-08-19
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.2.2.005
Title: Create a better mechanism for cadesc updates

Certificate authorities tend to be updated more often than gx-map
releases come out.  In particular, I've had to put out (so far)
two point releases, 0.5.2.1 and 0.5.2.2, just for CA updates.

Decouple *.cadesc releases from gx-map releases.  Include the latest
*.cadesc files in each gx-map release, but in addition maintain
and release a separate tarball (perhaps just versioned by date)
containing just the *.cadesc files.  Provide a command that, given
a gx-map installation directory and a cadesc tarball, updates the
etc/gx-map/ca-config directory; allow for user-modified files.

(I had some vague thoughts about downloading updates automatically,
but I think I'd rather just let people grab the tarball; if it can
be installed with a single command, that's good enough.)

Fixed:
Created a new gx-install-cadesc command.
Each release includes a newly generated gx-map-cadesc-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz
file, which is automatically installed by gx-install-cadesc during
installation.  New gx-map-cadesc tarballs can be installed into an
existing gx-map installation by the gx-map owner.
gx-map release 0.5.2.2.005
