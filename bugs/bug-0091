gx-map bug 0091
Date: Fri 2006-05-19
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1.007
Status: Open
Title: TG: Propagated requests are re-submitted

Summary:
This is TeraGrid-specific.

With the new gx-propagate interface, requests made at one site are
propagated into the TGCDB.  This causes AMIE packets to be sent out
and/or causes the list of DNs in the database to be updated, which
in turn causes the request to be submitted again.  (The first time,
the SOURCE will be "user", "admin", or something else; the second
request will have its SOURCE set to "TGCDB".)

I don't know of a good solution to this.  Fortunately, it's not
a serious problem.  Since the second request has its SOURCE set to
"TGCDB", it will not be propagated again, so there won't be more than
two occurrences.  The result is a minor inefficiency, not a Sorcerer's
Apprentice phenomenon.
