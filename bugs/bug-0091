gx-map bug 0091
Date: Fri 2006-05-19
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1.007
Status: Open
Title: TG: Propagated requests are re-submitted

Summary:
This is TeraGrid-specific.

With the new gx-propagate interface, requests made at one site are
propagated into the TGCDB.  This causes AMIE packets to be sent out
and/or causes the list of DNs in the database to be updated, which
in turn causes the request to be submitted again.  (The first time,
the SOURCE will be "user", "admin", or something else; the second
request will have its SOURCE set to "TGCDB".)

I don't know of a good solution to this.  Fortunately, it's not
a serious problem.  Since the second request has its SOURCE set to
"TGCDB", it will not be propagated again, so there won't be more than
two occurrences.  The result is a minor inefficiency, not a Sorcerer's
Apprentice phenomenon.

There may be a solution to this.  If gx-propagate is successful,
update the tgcdb-mappings file (or a separate file?) to reflect the
new mapping, rather than waiting for the information to come back
from the TGCDB.

This needs more thought.  There could be timing issues.  For example, I
update tgcdb-mappings because I passed a mapping to gx-propagate, then
I get an incoming AMIE packet that doesn't include the new mapping.
Possibly there needs to be a delay (ugh).  It's not a huge deal;
don't try to implement this until the kinks are worked out.
