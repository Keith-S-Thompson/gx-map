gx-map bug 0035
Date: Mon 2005-06-27
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: Store all DNs in new (GT3+) form

Summary:
Requests are stored with the DN in the form given by the user, which
could be either the GT2 form (/USERID=...) or the GT3 form (/UID=...),
or even the OpenSSL 0.9.6 form (/0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1=...).

Instead, store all DNs in the new (GT3+, OpenSSL 0.9.7+) form, doing
the conversion in gx-check-requests, and perhaps also in gx-request.
(If gx-request does the conversion in a way that's visible to the user,
print a brief message explaining what's going on.)

Modify gx-convert-log to do this conversion.

gx-gen-mapfile and any other tools that read the requests.log file can
then assume that all DNs are in the new form, which should simplify
things a bit.  It would also make log file analysis a bit easier.

This change should be made in conjunction with allowing proxy DNs (bug-0026).

Fixed:
gx-convert-log.in 1.10
gx-request.in 1.4
gx-map release 0.5.0a1
