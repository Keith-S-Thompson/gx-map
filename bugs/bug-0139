gx-map bug 0139
Date: Wed 2007-03-14
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.3.2.019
Title: Syntax errors in *.cadesc files not detected.

The fix for bug-0080, a problem reading an incomplete requests.log
file, was to ignore any syntax errors resulting from a log file that
is currently being written; a trailing incomplete record is ignored.

The fix should apply only to multi-record files; a syntax error in
a file being read with "Read_Records '-single' ..." should be reported.

This showed up as a failure to detect a syntax error that appears
in revisions 1.5 and 1.6 of "7c0f6d74.switch-personal.cadesc".
That file was not included in the 0.5.3.2 release (since the CRL is in
DER format), so it didn't affect anything.  The error was a comment
beginning with a ':' rather than a '#' character, and ignoring it
is actually harmless.  However, it could also cause errors in other
*.cadesc files to be ignored, as well as errors in a user request
file or in a DB request file.

Fixed:
GX.pm.in 1.15
gx-map release 0.5.3.2.019
