gx-map bug 0111
Date: Fri 2006-08-11
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: Use Carp module

Replace handcrafted traceback code in Gridmap_Utils with the standard
Carp module.  (First, figure out how Carp works; quick experiments seem
to indicate that routines that *arent'* supposed to print tracebacks
actually do so.)
