gx-map bug 0132
Date: Wed 2007-02-07
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Abe Singer <abe@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Consider disallowing re-mapping of DNs.

Currently, gx-map allows a DN to be remapped from one account to
another.  In other words, if a DN is mapped to user1, and user2 maps
that same DN to his own acount, then that overrides the original
mapping *without user1's permission*.

Note that the DN will actually be mapped to both accounts, but
in the current implementation the mapping will be "user2,user1".

Consider how to address this.  Should an attempt to re-map an existing
DN be ignored?  Should it be allowed only for an administrator?
Should multiple usernames be listed in chronological order rather
than reverse chronological order?

Requiring users to prove that they own the certificates they're
mapping (see bug-0064) will address much of this, but it's still
worth thinking about.
