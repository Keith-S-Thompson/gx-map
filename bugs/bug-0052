gx-map bug 0052
Date: Fri 2005-10-14
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a1
Status: Fixed ?
Title: Check for non-root chown fails when running as root

Summary:
Kazi Anwar <kazi@ncsa.uiuc.edu> ran into this today while trying to
install gx-map 0.4.5.

gx-check-requests calls Gridmap_Utils::Dir_Error() which, among
other things, attempts to determine whether the data directory allows
non-root chowns (which would open a security hole, allowing forged
requests).  If it's running as root, it attempts to drop its root
privileges before doing the check.  This fails, incorrectly reporting
that non-root chown *is* allowed, and causing gx-check-requests
to terminate.

The code that attempts to drop root privileges is:

    if ($running_as_root) {
	$< = 1;
    }
    ... test chown ...
    if ($running_as_root) {
	$< = 0;
    }

$< is the real UID; I think it actually needs to set $>, the effective
UID.

Installing gx-map and running gx-check-requests as root is not
recommended anyway; see bug-0053.

I think I'm actually going to leave this un-corrected for now.
If there's any good reason to support running as root, I can fix it
later; if not, the code will go away anyway.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.100
gx-map release 0.5.0a3
