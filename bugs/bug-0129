gx-map bug 0129
Date: Mon 2007-01-22
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.3.2.005
Title: Check for admin requests in gx-check-requests, not gx-gen-mapfile

Currently, gx-check-requests records the owner of each request,
and gx-gen-mapfile checks whether the owner is an administrator.
The ownership information being checked by gx-gen-mapfile could
be years old (the oldest existing request is from 2003-07-26).
This won't matter much if the set of administrators remains constant
over the years.  However, some sites prefer to allow individual users
to act as administrators, and even at SDSC has changed from "globus"
to "gxmap".

This led to the requirement for the "-old-admins" and "-new-admin"
options to the gx-convert-log command.  It can make it necessary to
use gx-convert-log when it would not otherwise be needed, for example,
if a former administrator leaves the organization.  Finally, it's
error-prone; at least one site has removed an administrator but not
updated requests.log.

Instead, the check for an administrator should be done only in
gx-check-requests, immediately after the request was submitted.
Use the "SOURCE" attribute for this; any value other than "user"
implies an administrator request.  (It becomes important to make sure
this continues to be true.)

The gx-convert-log command no longer needs to concern itself with
who is or isn't an administrator so the "-old-admins", "-new-admin",
and "-force" options can be deleted.  It can no longer set the
SOURCE attribute for records that don't already have one, but all
requests.log files going back to release 0.4.0 should already have
SOURCE attributes; print an error message and die if any don't.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.290
gx-convert-log.in 1.33
gx-map release 0.65.3.2.005
