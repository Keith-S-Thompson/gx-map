gx-map bug 0028
Date: Mon 2005-06-20
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed ?
Title: In interactive mode, warn about secondary mappings

Summary:
There are several secondary mappings in the requests.log files for
SDSC and Caltech's TG clusters.  As far as i can tell, they're all
errors (they should be primary mappings).  In general, the feature
seems to be used more often by accident than deliberately.

Suggested fix:
In "gx-map -interactive", try to explain more clearly what a secondary
mapping is (that's going to be difficult to do briefly).  Warn the
user not to attempt to do this unless he knows what he's doing,
and add an "Are you sure?" prompt.

Fix:
Secondary mappings have been eliminated altogether, so no warning
is necessary.

Fixed:
Multiple files.
