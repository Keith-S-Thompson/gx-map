gx-map bug 0063
Date: Fri 2006-01-20
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Open
Title: Feature: Quick CA revocation

Summary:
If a CA is compromised, there's currently no good way to disable it
across multiple sites.  Each site can remove the signing certificate
file from each system.  Sites using gx-ca-update also need to update
the gx-ca-update cron job or the list file; otherwise the files will
be automatically reinstalled.  This has to be done manually at each
site, which could be a problem if a compromised is discovered late
at night or over a weekend or holiday.

Bill Link and I recently discussed one partial solution: have the
affected CA revoke its own signing certificate.  This assumes that
Globus recognizes such a revocation (i.e., that it checks the CRL
before trying to use the CA certificate itself).  (Preliminary testing
with Globus 2.4.3 indicates that it does.)  This obviously isn't
a complete solution, since it relies on the compromised CA itself,
but it's probably a good idea to do this anyway (if possible).

Another possible solution is to add a new option to gx-ca-update.  The
argument would be the URL for a file containing status information for
CAs.  If a CA is compromised, this file could be updated with an entry
for that CA, indicating that it's not to be trusted.  If gx-ca-update
sees such an entry, it would remove all files associated with that CA
(*.0, *.r0, *.signing_policy) and refuse to reinstall them.

This is basically a crude form of CRL.  It would (probably) not
be signed; gx-ca-update would just trust whatever it finds at the
specified URL.  (Or, with extra work, a mechanism could be implemented
to cryptographically sign it.)
