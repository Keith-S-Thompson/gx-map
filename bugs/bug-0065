gx-map bug 0065
Date: Wed 2006-01-25
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Fixed 0.5.0e8
Title: Remove stale locks

Summary:
Both gx-check-requests and gx-ca-update create lock files in the var
directory to prevent two simultaneous instances of the program from
interfering with each other.  If a machine crashes while one of these
commands is running, or if the program itself crashes, the lock file
is left in place, preventing the program from running again until
the lock is manually removed.

Consider some mechanism for automatically removing lock files.  A lock
file that's older than the most recent system start can be removed
(is there a portable way to determine this?).  I've just added code
to write the process ID to the lock file; if that process isn't
running, the lock file can *probably* be removed.  (Both of these
can be checked only on the same host where the lock file was created.)

Be careful not to remove a lock that shouldn't be removed.  For
example, if a lock is left in place because the program crashed, it's
best to track down the cause of the crash before removing the lock.

An intermediate solution might be to provide a new tool (gx-unlock?)
that checks for lock files, prints its best guess about whether they
can be safely removed, and asks whether to remove them (or goes ahead
and removes them with a "-force" option).

Fix:
Created gx-remove-locks tool (interactive).

The original title of this bug was "Automatically remove stale locks".
On further thought, I've decided that *automatically* removing stale
locks is a bad idea.  If a stale lock exists, it's likely to be
because the program that created it crashed; a human should track
down the cause before re-enabling the system.

Fixed:
gx-remove-locks.in 1.2
gx-map release 0.5.0e8
