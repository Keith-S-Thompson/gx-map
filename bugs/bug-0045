gx-map bug 0045
Date: Thu 2005-07-21
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: gx-ingest: Don't add GT2-style DNs

Summary:
The gx-ingest command currently invokes gx-request for each DN in
the input grid-mapfile.  If the input file contains both GT2-style
and GT3/GT4-style DNs (/USERID=... vs. /UID=...), this will result
in redundant requests.

Suggested fix:
Have gx-ingest translate all DNs to the new form.  For each mapping,
check whether it's already been applied.

Fixed:
gx-ingest.in 1.15
gx-map release 0.5.0a1
