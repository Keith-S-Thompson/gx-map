gx-map bug 0012
Date: Mon 2005-03-28
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update command-line errors not logged

Summary:
The gx-ca-update command does not log command-line errors, leading
to possible confusion if a cron command is incorrect.

For example: No CA matching 2ca73e82

This is probably not much of an issue.  The message is printed to
stderr, which should be e-mailed to the user owning the cron job.
I saw this on rocks-121, which wasn't forwarding e-mail properly.
