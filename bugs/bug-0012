gx-map bug 0012
Date: Mon 2005-03-28
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Title: gx-ca-update command-line errors not logged

Summary:
The gx-ca-update command does not log command-line errors, leading
to possible confusion if a cron command is incorrect.

For example: No CA matching 2ca73e82

This may not be much of an issue; the message is printed to stderr,
which should be e-mailed to the user owning the cron job.  I saw this
on rocks-121; probably the e-mail wasn't forwarded properly.
