gx-map bug 0057
Date: Thu 2005-10-27
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0a4
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a5
Title: gx-gen-mapfile needs to check existence of input files

Summary:
gx-gen-mapfile doesn't explicitly check for the existence of its
input files (var/requests.log or whatever is specified).  If an
input file doesn't exist, the current behavior depends on whether an
output file was specified.  If no output file is specified, it dies
in Read_Records with a "No such file or directory" message.  If an
output file is specified, it never gets to Read_Records; instead,
it dies mysteriously in Long_Time_Image (because it looks at the
mtime of the input file):

Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) at .../lib/Gridmap_Utils.pm line 571.
Traceback:
    .../lib/Gridmap_Utils.pm:571 in Gridmap_Utils::Long_Time_Image
    .../sbin/gx-gen-mapfile:328 in main::Update_List
    .../sbin/gx-gen-mapfile:159

Fixed:
Check for existence of input log files before trying to use them.
