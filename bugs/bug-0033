gx-map bug 0033
Date: Sat 2005-06-25
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.9.019
Title: Distinguish between local and global mappings

Summary:
A fix for bug-0030, "Cross-site propagation", is a prerequisite
for this.

The initial implementation of cross-site propagation (specifically
for the TGCDB) will probably use an "everything-is-global" model.
This has the advantage of relative simplicity, but it means that
all mappings for a site have to be fed into the cross-site database.
It might be desirable to distinguish between local mappings and global
mappings.  The difference is that local mappings are not propagated
to the cross-site database, and are not affected by updates from the
cross-site database.

In some cases, it might also be useful to distinguish among multiple
cross-site databases (for a site that's a member of two or more
virtual organizations).

Proposed solution:
Add a "scope" attribute to each request.  Permitted values are
"local" and "global", or possibly "local" and any of an arbitrary
set of identifiers.

The core gx-map code would ignore this attribute.  The cross-site
plugin code would use it to determine how to treat the request;
a "local" request is not propagated to the database, and is not
overridden by incoming updates.

This change would add a degree of complexity for what may be
a minimal benefit.  It would avoid propagating some mappings,
but most such mappings probably wouldn't be propagated anyway,
since the user wouldn't be in the database and/or wouldn't have an
account on the remote machine.  If the user does have an account on
the remote machine, propagating the mapping should be harmless and
possibly useful.

A disadvantage of *not* distinguishing between local and global
mappings is that sites would have to inject their existing mappings
into the database before they start accepting updates from the
database.

At this point, I'm inclined *not* to implement this.  I've added a
"-merge-file" option to merge one or more existing grid-mapfiles
into the generated grid-mapfile.  A site wishing to maintain a set
of local mappings, not to be propagated, is likely to have its own
mechanism for generating it anyway (such as PSC's web interface).
Or the local grid-mapfile could be generated by a distinct gx-map
installation, though that's likely to be confusing for users.

Fri 2007-06-29:

I'm going to implement this after all.  It will be used for requests
submitted by gx-db-check-requests, so that gx-check-requests can know
not to invoke gx-propagate.  The purpose of this is to save time,
not to change the functionality -- but the feature will be available.
I'm thinking of restricting this to administrators.  (Nah, let ordinary
users use it.)  This will be made available via a new "-local" option
to gx-request.

See bug-0092.

Fixed:
gx-request.in 1.83
gx-chek-requests.in 1.112
gx-map release 0.5.9.019
