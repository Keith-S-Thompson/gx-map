gx-map bug 0128
Date: Mon 2007-01-22
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Fixed 0.5.3.2.001
Title: gx-gen-mapfile getpwnam performance bottleneck

The getpwnam function appears to be a performance bottleneck (more
so on some platforms than on others).

A solution is to load the entire passwd file (or equivalent) into
an internal data structure on startup, and query that data structure
rather than calling getpwnam (or getpwuid).  Fortunately getpwnam and
getpwuid are already called via wrappers, Get_PW_Name and Get_PW_UID
in the Gridmap_Utils package.

I tested this using the current SDSC requests.log file.  On
uffda.sdsc.edu (a 2.8 GHz Xeon system) this reduced both CPU time
and wall clock time for "gx-gen-mapfile" from 10.3 to 2.7 seconds,
or to about 26% of the original.

On bg-login1.sdsc.teragrid.org (Power3, 375MHz), CPU time was reduced
from 9.8 to 7.85 seconds  or about 80% of the original; wall clock
time, by contrast, was reduced from 35.4 seconds to 7.9 seconds,
or about 22% of the original.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.286
gx-map release 0.5.3.2.001
