gx-map bug 0121
Date: Thu 2006-11-09
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2.022
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update always leaves a lock file when it dies

The gx-ca-update command always leaves a lock file in place when it
dies prematurely.  In some cases, this isn't necessary.  In particular,
there have been some recent problems on lctb1.sdsc.edu, where the root
file system has filled up.  gx-ca-update fails trying to copy a file,
and dies.  In this particular case, no sharable resources need to
remain locked, so it should be able to remove the lock before dying.

The new "-nodownload" feature should alleviate this particular problem,
but the general problem is still there.

For each command that creates a lock file, look at all the ways it can
die, and consider whether the lock should be released.  This probably
requires an "Unlock_And_Die" routine.  Also consider how long the
lock really needs to be held.
