gx-map bug 0157
Date: Wed 2007-06-27
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: Consider a non-world-writable new-requests directory

So far, this is only a vague idea.

The gx-request command writes a request to the new-requests directory,
which is world-writable (permissions 1733, rwx-wx-wt).

In practice, most requests are submitted by the owner account.
Consider using *two* new-requests directories, one for ordinary
user requests with the current permissions, and another owned by the
GX_MAP_OWNER account with permissions 755, or even 700, to be used
only by the GX_MAP_OWNER.

Let's call the directories new-requests.pub and new-requests.priv.

gx-check-requests would have to check both directories.
Requests in the new-requests.priv directory can be assumed to be
administrative requests.  If ADDITIONAL_ADMINS is empty, requests
in the new-requests.pub directory can be assumed *not* to be
administrative requests.

I'm not (yet) convinced that this really buys us anything, since the
world-writable new-requests.pub directory is still there.  On the
other hand, a site could choose to disable user-submitted requests
and remove or chmod the new-requests.pub directory.  On the other
other hand, I'm not comfortable with the security model changing
depending on whether ADDITIONAL_ADMINS is empty or not.
