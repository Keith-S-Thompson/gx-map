gx-map bug 0092
Date: Fri 2006-05-19
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: Multiple gx-request invocations are slow

Summary:
In some cases, gx-request may be invoked many times in a row (hundreds,
or even thousands).  This can happen due to running a script generated
by gx-ingest or an initial run of gx-db-check-requests.  On chester,
this seems to average about 0.45 second per request, or 135 requests
per minute.

I suspect that a great deal of the overhead is caused by re-invoking
the gx-request script and re-loading Perl interpreter and various
perl modules.

Add a new function Gridmap_Utils::Submit_Request that processes
a single request.  Use a relatively simple interface, and let the
caller be responsible for getting the arguments right (for example,
the caller must supply the DN itself, not a certificate file from
which to extract it).

Let gx-request call this function to create a request file.

Create either a new command, or an option to gx-request, that takes
a text file as input and invokes Gridmap_Utils::Submit_Request for
each line.  gx-ingest could create a text file to be submitted rather
than a shel script (or make it an option).

Measure the actual speedup, if any.
