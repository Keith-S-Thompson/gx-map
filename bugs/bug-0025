gx-map bug 0025
Date: Fri 2005-05-06
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.3
Status: Fixed 0.5.0c7
Title: Get information on AusGrid CA

Summary:
The AusGrid CA (along with several other CAs in Australia) no longer
provides its CA files individually.  Instead, it provides them in
*.tar.gz files, which gx-ca-update can't handle.  The AusGrid CA
is marked as disabled for now.

Suggested fix:
Bug the AusGrid CA people to provide their files individually.
(I've already sent e-mail to someone who turned out not to be the
right person, but forwarded it to someone who was.)

Suggested fix:
Grab the tarballs, unpack them, and make them available myself.
Probably not worth the effort.

Suggested fix:
Update gx-ca-update to support grabbing tarballs and extracting
specified files from them.  Define a new syntax for the argument
to Cache_File.  Almost certainly not worth the effort.

Actual fix:
Found the c1421828.0 and c1421828.signing_policy files at
epp.ph.unimelb.edu.au.  (They're also available on rocksclusters.org.)

Fixed:
ca/c1421828.ausgrid.cadesc 1.6
gx-map release 0.5.0c7
