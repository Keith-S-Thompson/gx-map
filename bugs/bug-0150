gx-map bug 0150
Date: Thu 2007-05-03
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update -warn-crl removes expiring CRL

Due to a logical flaw in the handling of the "-warn-crl" and
"-expire-crl" options of the gx-ca-update command, they both behave
identically.  The "-warn-crl" option, in addition to issuing a warning,
will actually remove the CRL, even without the use of the "-UNSAFE"
option.

Proposed fix:

Delete *all* the "unsafe" options.  (I've sent a message to the
gx-map@sdsc.edu mailing list warning about this change.)
