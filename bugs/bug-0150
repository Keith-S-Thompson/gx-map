gx-map bug 0150
Date: Thu 2007-05-03
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Fixed 0.5.9.002
Title: gx-ca-update -warn-crl removes expiring CRL

Due to a logical flaw in the handling of the "-warn-crl" and
"-expire-crl" options of the gx-ca-update command, they both behave
identically.  The "-warn-crl" option, in addition to issuing a warning,
will actually remove the CRL, even without the use of the "-UNSAFE"
option.

Proposed fix:

Delete the "-warn-crl" option and *all* the "unsafe" options:
    -allow-missing-crl
    -expire-crl time
    -ignore-disable
(I've sent a message to the gx-map@sdsc.edu mailing list warning
about this change.)

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.148
gx-map release 0.5.9.002
