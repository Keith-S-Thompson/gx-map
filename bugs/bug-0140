gx-map bug 0140
Date: Wed 2007-03-14
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2.020
Status: Fixed 0.5.9.006
Title: Certificate is installed if CRL has expired

If a CRL has expired, gx-ca-update installs the CA certificate but
not the CRL.  Since Globus responsds to a missing CRL by accepting
all certificates, this creates a security hole.

This bug does not occur in the 0.5.3.2 release; in that release,
neither the CA certificate nor the CRL is installed.

I suspect this bug was introduced in gx-ca-update.in revision 1.136.

...

I've been unable to reproduce the exact bug I saw before.  A couple
of things I have found:

    If a certificate is newly installed and the CRL is then found
    to have expired, the temporary copy of the certificate is left
    in place.  This should be mostly harmless, but it's definitely
    a bug, caused by use of "delete" rather than "unlink" in
    Finalize_Certificate (actually it should do both).

    If a certificate already exists, and a CRL is found to have
    expired, the CRL is not installed but the certificate is left in
    place.  If an older version of the CRL already exists, that's ok.
    If there is no CRL, that's a problem.  We probably want to just
    go ahead and install expired CRLs.


...

file if you really want to read them.]

Ok, this has been confusing, but I think I've got it worked out.

Given the current code, I believe that, if the cadesc file specifies
that a CRL is required, the only time we'll be left with a certificate
but no CRL is if the CA was previously installed by itself (which could
easily happen).  gx-ca-update itself will refuse to do the initial
installation of the certificate if it can't also install a valid CRL.

So the additional step is:

    In Finalize_Certificate(), if a CRL is required, and the CA
    certificate exists, and the CRL does not exist, then disable the
    CA certificate (by renaming it to xxxxxxxx.0.disabled) and treat
    it as a fatal error.

Since this fixes an existing vulnerability, there's no real concern
about a brief time window.

Fixed:
gx-ca-update.in 1.151
gx-map release 0.5.9.006
