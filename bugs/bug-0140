gx-map bug 0140
Date: Wed 2007-03-14
Severity: High
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2.020
Status: Open
Title: Certificate is installed if CRL has expired

If a CRL has expired, gx-ca-update installs the CA certificate but
not the CRL.  Since Globus responsds to a missing CRL by accepting
all certificates, this creates a security hole.

This bug does not occur in the 0.5.3.2 release; in that release,
neither the CA certificate nor the CRL is installed.

I suspect this bug was introduced in gx-ca-update.in revision 1.136.
