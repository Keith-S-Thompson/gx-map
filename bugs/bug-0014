gx-map bug 0014
Date: Tue 2005-03-29
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1
Status: Open
Title: use Class::Struct

Summary:
The gx-map system makes extensive use of structures implemented as
hash references, with the keys representing member names.  This is
vulnerable to typos; for example:
    if (defined $ref->{some_feild}) ...
will quietly fail even if $ref->{some_field}) is defined.

Suggested fix:
Use Class::Struct.
Update Read_Records and Write_Records to work with Class::Struct objects.
Keep track of how many typos are found while converting the code,
and analyze the possible consequences of each one.
