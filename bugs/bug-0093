gx-map bug 0093
Date: Fri 2006-05-26
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.1
Status: Open
Title: Possible performance improvements for gx-gen-mapfile

Summary:
Currently, gx-gen-mapfile re-scans the requests.log file every time it
generates a new grid-mapfile.  This can get slow as the requests.log
file grows.  Instead, consider generating a global grid-mapfile.all
in gx-check-requests (probably by invoking "gx-gen-mapfile -all" from
gx-check-requests).  gx-gen-mapfile without the "-all" option would
then read from this file, doing the equivalent of "filter-grid-mapfile"
i.e., filtering out all mappings for accounts that don't exist on
the current machine).

Also, gx-gen-mapfile (actually Gridmap_Utils::Gen_Mappings) invokes
Gridmap_Utils::Get_PW for each user name, to determine whether the
account exists.  Other uses of Get_PW are less significant: it's
invoked when a request has a UID but no name, and it's invoked by
gx-gen-mapfile itself to get the user's real name (but only with
the "-real-name" option).  Instead, consider slurping the entire
/etc/passwd file or equivalent into hashes, and index into that.
Do this by adding a "-slurp" option to Gridmap_Utils::Get_PW; with this
option, it initializes a cache if it hasn't already been initialized.
Initialially make this optional, and compare the performance.
