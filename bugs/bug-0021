gx-map bug 0021
Date: Tue 2005-04-26
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.2
Status: Fixed 0.4.3
Title: gx-map.conf.in mistakenly included in 0.4.2 release

Summary:
The new file gx-map.conf.in is a template file that will be used in
the new configuration system (see bug-0007).  Since this is a work
in progress, gx-map.conf.in should not be included in releases yet.
It was accidentally included in release 0.4.2, which could cause
confusion for installers.  (It didn't exist when 0.4.1 was released.)

Fixed:
make-release 1.7
gx-map release 0.4.3
(Note that the change in make-release will have to be backed out when
the new configuration system is ready.)
