gx-map bug 0002
Date: Wed 2005-03-23
Severity: Low
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1

Summary:
If the same mapping is added as a primary and as a secondary mapping,
it shows up as a double entry in the grid-mapfile.  This should
be harmless.

To reproduce:
% gx-map -add -dn '/O=FOO/CN=Phred Pharkle' -username phred
% gx-map -add -dn '/O=FOO/CN=Phred Pharkle' -username phred -secondary
% gx-check-requests -namespace KST
% gx-gen-mapfile /usr/local/apps/grid-security/grid-mapfile
% grep phred /usr/local/apps/grid-security/grid-mapfile
"/O=FOO/CN=Phred Pharkle" phred,phred
