gx-map bug 0019
Date: Tue 2005-04-19
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.2
Title: Change name of gx-map client to gx-request

Summary:
The name "gx-map" refers both to the package as a while and to the
client program.  This is confusing.  Change the name of the client
program from "gx-map" to "gx-request".  For compatibility, make
"gx-map" a symlink to "gx-request", but deemphasize it.  For any
tools that invoke gx-map (including gx-ingest), check for "gx-request"
and fall back to "gx-map" only if it exists and "gx-request" doesn't.

Fixed:
gx-request.in 1.1
gx-ingest.in 1.10
install-gx-map 1.36
gx-map.in (removed)
gx-map-0.4.5
