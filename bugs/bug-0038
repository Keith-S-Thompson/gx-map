gx-map bug 0038
Date: Wed 2005-06-29
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: Simplify GT2/GT3+ compatibility in gx-gen-mapfile

Summary:
The current code for generating a grid-mapfile that's compatible with
both GT2 and GT3+ is more complex than it needs to be.  It involves
duplicating records and partially treating the DNs as separate
entities; see the DN_List and Dup_Ref functions in Gridmap_Utils.pm.in.

Proposed solution:
We already store all DNs in GT3+ form only (see bug-0035).  Postpone
handling the GT2 form until we're actually writing the grid-mapfile
entries.  This will make the code much simpler and will make it more
feasible to add an option to gx-gen-mapfile to generate *only* the
new form.  (At this point, it probably doesn't make sense to provide
the option of generating only the old form.)  Or make new-form-only
the default and add a "-compatible" option to generate both.

A minor side effect is that a corresponding old and new DN will appear
next to each other in the grid-mapfile rather than being sorted along
with all the other DNs.  This is not significant.

Fix:
As described, with a "-compatible" option.

Fixed:
gx-gen-mapfile 1.55
gx-map release 0.5.0a1
