gx-map bug 0026
Date: Tue 2005-05-10
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Open
Title: Allow proxy DNs in gx-request

Summary:
An old-style proxy certificate has a DN ending in "/CN=proxy".
This may occur multiple times for delegated proxies.

If a user running the gx-request command (formerly gx-map) tries to
use the DN from a proxy certificate, that (invalid) DN will appear
in the grid-mapfile.

Suggested fix:
A new-style proxy certificate will have a DN ending in something
like "/CN=24583326" (consult the appropriate draft RFC for the exact
syntax); again, this may appear multiple times.

When specifying a DN for the gx-request command (formerly gx-map),
strip zero or more occurrences of "/CN=proxy" or "/CN=[0-9]+" from
the end of the string.

Add an option to allow the DN to be extracted from the current proxy.
(Perhaps this should be the default.)
