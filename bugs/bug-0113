gx-map bug 0113
Date: Sat 2006-08-19
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.2
Status: Open
Title: gx-ca-update: Complain about duplicate cadesc files

With updates of the *.cadesc files, particularly renaming files from
xxxxxxxx.foo.cadesc to xxxxxxxx.foo-old.cadesc, it's possible that the
ca-config directory could contain two or more files with the same hash.
I'm not sure what gx-ca-update will do if this is the case.  Find out
how it behaves now, and update it to detect and complain about this
if it happens.
