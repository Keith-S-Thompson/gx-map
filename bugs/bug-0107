gx-map bug 0107
Date: Wed 2006-08-02
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Open
Title: Integrate gx-map-cacl into gx-map

Consider integrating gx-map-cacl into the gx-map package, as an
auxiliary EXTRAS component like TGCDB.

Don't require multiple installations for multiple CAs; get attributes
(primarily the location of the index file) from the *.cadesc file,
and specify one or more CAs on the gx-check-cacl-index command line.

Consider changing the command name to something more generic than
gx-check-cacl-index, perhaps gx-check-ca-index.  Think (eventually)
about handling other index file formats (if they exist).
