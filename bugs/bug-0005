gx-map bug 0005
Date: Thu 2005-03-24
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.1

Summary:
New feature: In *.cadesc files, add a new attribute indicating that a
CRL is not required, perhaps "SHORT_TERM_ONLY yes".  If this attribute
is set, it's equivalent to specifying "-UNSAFE -allow-missing-crl"
just for that CA.

Currently, KCAs such as 85ca9edc (PSC) and 26bf3386 (USC) require
special handling, because gx-ca-update requires CRLs by default.
The consensus seems to be that CRLs are unnecessary for KCAs, since
they issue only short-term certificates (up to 10 days or so).
