gx-map bug 0066
Date: Wed 2006-01-25
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d1
Title: Race condition creating lock file

Summary:
Both gx-check-requests and gx-ca-update create lock files in the
var directory to prevent two simultaneous instances of the program
from interfering with each other.  Currently, the both do something
like this:

    if lock file exists
	print a message and exit
    create lock file
    do some work
    remove lock file

If another instance of the program runs at just the right time,
both could execute simultaneously:

    Instance 1				Instance 2
    Does lock file exist?  No.
					Does lock file exist?  No.
    Create lock file
					Create lock file
    Do stuff				Do stuff
    Remove lock file			Remove lock file

The problem is that we check for the file's existence and create it
in two separate steps.  Perl's open() function doesn't provide a way
to do this, but sysopen() does:

    sysopen my $Lock, $lock_file, O_WRONLY | O_EXCL | O_CREAT;

Put this into a function in Gridmap_Utils.

Fix:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.141
gx-ca-update.in 1.98
gx-check-requests.in 180
gx-map release 0.5.0d1
