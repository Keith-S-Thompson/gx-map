gx-map bug 0043
Date: Fri 2005-07-08
Severity: med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.4.5
Status: Fixed 0.5.0a1
Title: gx-request: clumsy handling of missing certificate file

Summary:
"gx-request -interactive" allows the user to specify a certificate file
name from which the DN is to be extracted.  If this file does not exist
or is not a certificate, gx-request continues to prompt for input;
it doesn't report an error until it's ready to submit the request.
Also, the error message, "No DN specified", is unclear.

Suggested fix:
Extract the DN from the certificate file inside the input loop;
keep trying if no DN can be extracted.  On failure, explain what the
problem was.  On success, show the DN.

Fixed:
gx-request.in 1.14
gx-map release 0.5.0a1
