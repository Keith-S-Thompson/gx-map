gx-map bug 0151
Date: Wed 2007-05-16
Severity: Medium
Reported by: David Carver <dcarver@tacc.utexas.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.3
Status: Open
Title: gx-install-cadesc chokes if backup dir already exists

The gx-install-cadesc command renames the existing "ca-config"
directory for backup purposes before it creates a new one.  The backup
directory name consists of "ca-config-" followed by a timestamp,
determined by the modification time of the existing "ca-config"
directory (e.g., ca-config-2006-12-09-105510Z).

If a directory (or file) by that name already exists, the
gx-install-cadesc command dies with an error message, such as:

ca-config-2007-05-15-070351Z: Directory not empty
Traceback:
    /usr/local/apps/gx-map-0.5.3.3/sbin/gx-install-cadesc:170 in main::Backup
    /usr/local/apps/gx-map-0.5.3.3/sbin/gx-install-cadesc:116

This can happen if an update is applied multiple times.

Proposed fix: Ensure that the backup directory has a unique name.
By default, name it "ca-config-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSSZ-000"; increment
the last field as needed until we find something that doesn't exist.
(There's a potential race condition here, but I don't think it's
worth worrying about.)
