gx-map bug 0106
Date: Tue 2006-08-01
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.2.1
Status: Fixed 0.5.?
Title: Check for Net::Domain doesn't work

Gridmap_Utils.pm tries to check whether the Net::Domain exists; if
not, the Get_Hostname function falls back to the external "hostname"
command.

It does this by doing
    eval { require Net::Domain };
in the BEGIN block and checking the value of $@.  It turns out that
if the module doesn't exist, this aborts compilation rather than
setting $@.

It needs to eval a string rather than a block:
    eval '{ require Net::Domain }';

(This also needs to be done for Time::HiRes.)

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.211
gx-map release 0.5.?
