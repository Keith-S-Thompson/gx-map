gx-map bug 0068
Date: Wed 2006-01-25
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Fixed 0.5.0d1
Title: Clearer error message when var directory doesn't exist

Summary:
The var subdirectory is always a symbolic link to some other directory.
It might not exist for any of a number of reasons, even when the
installation directory does.  Most commands ignore this possibility
and die on the first attempt to access a file or directory under
the var directory.  Instead, each program should explicitly check
the existence of the var directory on startup; if it doesn't exist,
die with a more detailed error message, including the location of
the installation directory and where the symlink points.

Fixed:
Gridmap_Utils.pm.in 1.142
gx-ca-update.in 1.99
gx-check-requests.in 1.81
gx-gen-mapfile.in 1.79
gx-request.in 1.38
gx-map release 0.5.0d1
