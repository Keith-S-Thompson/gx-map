gx-map bug 0068
Date: Wed 2006-01-25
Severity: Med
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.0d0
Status: Open
Title: Clearer error message when var directory doesn't exist

Summary:
The var subdirectory is always a symbolic link to some other directory.
It might not exist for any of a number of reasons, even when the
installation directory does.  Most commands ignore this possiblity
and die on the first attempt to access a file or directory under
the var directory.  Instead, each program should explcitly check
the existence of the var directory on startup; if it doesn't exist,
die with a more detailed error message, including the location of
the installation directory and where the symlink points.
