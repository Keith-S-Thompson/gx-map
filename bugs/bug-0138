gx-map bug 0138
Date: Thu 2007-03-08
Severity: Medium
Reported by: Keith Thompson <kst@sdsc.edu>
Version: 0.5.3.2
Status: Open
Title: Automate requests.log conversion

When upgrading from an older to a newer version of gx-map, the current
procedure is to install the new version from scratch, then manually
run gx-convert-log and possibly gx-cleanup-logs, and manually install
the resulting converted requests.log file.

Provide an option to configure-gx-map to specify an existing gx-map
installation.  This will cause "make install" to convert and clean
up the requests.log file from the older release, and install it in
the new data directory.  Additional options may be used to control
the behavior of the gx-cleanup-logs command (gx-convert-log no longer
has any relevant options that need to be controlled).
