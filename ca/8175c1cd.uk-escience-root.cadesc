# MD5 and SHA1 fingerprints from 8175c1cd.0, downloaded Fri 2006-08-04
# Verified against IGTF 1.16 release,
# <https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/1.16/accredited/igtf-policy-installation-bundle-1.16.tar.gz>

# This certificate, along with one that it signs (hash adcbc9ef)
# supersede the old UK e-Science CA certificate (hash 01621954).

# On Mon 2007-09-17, it was announced on the tagpma-general mailing list
# that this CA may have been compromised (backups of the keys kept on
# USB drives in a safe are missing).  The plan is to re-key the root
# CA and re-sign any subordinate CAs.  Note that this CA certificate is
# self-signed and may only sign a single other certificate, namely the CA
# certificate for the UK e-Science CA (see adcbc9ef.uk-escience.cadesc).
