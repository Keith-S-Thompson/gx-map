The gx-ca-update program automatically installs signing certificates,
CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), and signing_policy files for
use with Globus.  This is a security-critical activity; mistakes
can easily leave your system vulnerable to unauthorized access.
I've designed the gx-ca-update program to minimize the risks, but I
can make no guarantees whatsoever.  The responsibility for securing
your system is entirely yours.

Before Globus will recognize a user or host certificate (or in the
case of a user certificate a proxy signed by the certificate),
it requires the certificate to be valid.  A user certificate
must have its subject name in the grid-mapfile (normally in
the /etc/grid-security directory).  It must also be signed by an
recognized CA (Certificate Authority).  The CA's signing certificate
and signing_policy files must be installed on your system (normally
in the /etc/grid-security/certificates directory).

One potential problem with this approach is that it's easy, using
OpenSSL commands, to create a forged CA certificate.

For example, suppose use John Smith has a certificate with the subject
name "/O=Grid/OU=example.org/CN=John Smith".  You have an entry
in your grid-mapfile that looks like:

"/O=Grid/OU=example.org/CN=John Smith" jsmith

The certificate was issued by a CA whose certificate has the subject
name "/O=Grid/OU=example.org/CN=example.org Root CA".

Using OpenSSL, I can easily generate my own forged CA certificate
with same subject name and use it to sign a forged user certificate
with the same subject name as John Smith's certificate.  This gives
me access to John Smith's account on your system -- but only if
I can fool you into installing my forged CA certificate in your
/etc/grid-security/certificates directory.  Thus the security of the
/etc/grid-security directory is critical.

The CERTIFICATE_MD5 attribute is the primary method for avoiding
forged signing certificates.  Each cadesc file distributed with
the gx-map system includes an MD5 fingerprint for the corresponding
signing certificate, and a comment indicating how I determined it.
You should double-check this yourself.  Each cadesc file specifies
URLs from which the files can be downloaded; you need to decide whether
you trust the specified sites.  Be careful out there.  I've indicated,
in each cadesc file, how I determined the MD5 fingerprint.

Globus makes CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) optional.  A CRL
specifies a list of certificates that have been revoked.  Each CRL
has a specified lifetime, forcing each site to download a new copy
periodically.  If you install a current CRL file (xxxxxxxx.r0),
Globus will reject any revoked certificates.  If you don't install a
CRL file at all, Globus will accept all certificates issued by the
corresponding CA, including revoked certificates.  If you have an
expired CRL, all certificates issued by the CA will be rejected.

By default, gx-ca-update requires current CRLs for all CAs.  If a
CRL is not available, the CA certificate will not be installed.  If a
CRL has expired and a new one is not available, the expired one will
be left in place.  The gx-ca-update command allows you to specify a
more lax policy if you wish, allowing CAs without CRLs and/or removing
CRLs that are about to expire, but only if you explicitly provide the
"-unsafe" command line option.
