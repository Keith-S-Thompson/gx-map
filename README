This is gx-map, a system for automated updates of Globus grid-mapfiles
and CA files.

The "gx-map" command is used to request the addition or deletion
of an entry in the grid-mapfile.  Users should normally run
"gx-map -interactive" and follow the instructions.

A user may map an arbitrary DN (distinguished name) to his own
Unix account.  An administrator (as specified in the config file)
may map any DN to any Unix account.

Some DNs may be mapped automatically without user intervention; in
particular, certificates issued by the NPACI and SDSC certificate
authorities (cacl) are automatically mapped to the corresponding
user account.  This is handled by a separate tool (not included here)
that watches for updates in the cacl index file and invokes gx-map.
(This applies only to systems within the SDSC namespace.)

All commands accept a "-help" option to print a brief usage message
and a "-version" option to display the current version.  The gx-map
command also accepts a "-long-help" option with information on
non-interactive use.

Support for propagation of information across sites is still
incomplete.  (The new SOURCE attribute is intended to enable tracking
where each transaction was entered.)

The gx-ca-update command (new in release 0.4.0) handles automated
installation and maintenance of certificate, signing_policy, and CRL
files for CAs (Certificate Authorities).

Documentation is still somewhat lacking, but see the following files
for information:

    README              This file, general information
    README.CA           Information about the gx-ca-update command.
    README.CA-SECURITY  Security-specific information about gx-ca-update .
    README.TeraGrid     TeraGrid-specific information (which may also
                        be of interest for non-TeraGrid sites).
    README.Upgrade      Upgrading from gx-map 0.3 to 0.4.X.
    README.Cross-Site   Using gx-map across multiple sites.

I gave a brief presentation on gx-map at GlobusWorld 2004.  An expanded
version of the PowerPoint slides from that presentation can be found
in gx-map.ppt in this distribution; gx-map.pdf is the same presentation
in PDF format.

The README, README.*, Relnotes, gx-map.ppt, and gx-map.pdf files are
installed in the etc subdirectory when you install gx-map.

Future releases will include man pages.
