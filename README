This is gx-map, a system for automated updates of Globus grid-mapfiles
and CA files.

The "gx-map" command is used to request the addition or deletion
of an entry in the grid-mapfile.  Users should normally run
"gx-map -interactive" and follow the instructions.

A user may map an arbitrary DN (distinguished name) to his own
Unix account.  An administrator (as specified in the config file)
may map any DN to any Unix account.

Some DNs may be mapped automatically without user intervention; in
particular, certificates issued by the NPACI and SDSC certificate
authorities (cacl) are automatically mapped to the corresponding
user account.  This is handled by a separate tool (not included here)
that watches for updates in the cacl index file and invokes gx-map.

All commands accept a "-help" option to print a brief usage message
and a "-version" option to display the current version.  The gx-map
command also accepts a "-long-help" option with information on
non-interactive use.

Support for propagation of information across sites is still
incomplete.  The "ncsa-sdsc-user-map" is specific to NCSA and SDSC
systems, and is out of date.  (The new SOURCE attribute is intended
to enable tracking where each transaction was entered.)

Documentation is still sadly lacking.  General information is available
in this README file; information about the gx-ca-update command is
in README.CA and README.CA-SECURITY.  Future releases will include
man pages.

There is a known bug in the gx-map system (inadvertently discovered
by Mei-Hui Su of ISI) that can affect sites with multiple systems
sharing a data directory.

The scenario:

1.  A user runs gx-map, generating a request file (owned by the user)
    in the shared data directory.

2.  A few minutes later, the gx-check-requests command runs under
    control of a cron job.  Recall that gx-check-requests runs on only
    a single system.  It picks up the request file, processes it, and
    appends it (with some annotations) to the shared requests.log file.

3.  Shortly after that, the gx-gen-mapfile command is run, possibly
    on several systems.  It sees that the requests.log file has been
    updated, and re-generates the grid-mapfile.

The problem: The user who ran gx-map in step 1 does not happen to have
an account on the system running gx-check-requests.  As a result,
the record appended to the requests.log file has a valid OWNER_UID
field (the numeric UID of the user), but does not have an OWNER_NAME
field (since gx-check-requests can't determine the name).  Currently,
gx-gen-mapfile ignores requests without a valid OWNER_NAME field.

This bug was discovered in release 0.3, and has not yet been fixed
as of release 0.4.0.
