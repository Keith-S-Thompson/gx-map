This is gx-map, a system for automated updates of Globus grid-mapfiles.

This is release 0.3; more documentation will follow later.

Release 0.1 was an SDSC internal system.

Release 0.2 was an alpha release, reworked for use at multiple sites.
Use of release 0.2 is no longer recommended.

Release 0.3 is probably somewhere between alpha and beta (depending on
how many bugs turn up).  It includes fixes for some fairly nasty bugs.

The "gx-map" command is used to request the addition or deletion
of an entry in the grid-mapfile.  Users should normally run
"gx-map -interactive" and follow the instructions.

A user may map an arbitrary DN (distinguished name) to his own
Unix account.  An administrator (as specified in the config file)
may map any DN to any Unix account.

Some DNs may be mapped automatically without user intervention; in
particular, certificates issued by the NPACI/SDSC certificate authority
(cacl) are automatically mapped to the corresponding user account.
This is handled by a separate tool (not included here) that watches
for updates in the cacl index file and invokes gx-map.

All commands accept a "-help" option to print a brief usage message
and a "-version" option to display the current version.  The gx-map
command also accepts a "-long-help" option with information on
non-interactive use.
