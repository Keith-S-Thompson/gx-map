This is gx-map, a system for automated updates of Globus grid-mapfiles.

This is an initial release; more documentation will follow later.

The "gx-map" command is used to request the addition or deletion
of an entry in the grid-mapfile.  Users should normally run
"gx-map -interactive" and follow the instructions.

A user may map an arbitrary DN (distinguished name) to his own
Unix account.  An administrator (as specified in the config file)
may map any DN to any Unix account.

Some DNs may be mapped automatically without user intervention; in
particular, certificates issued by the NPACI/SDSC certificate authority
(cacl) are automatically mapped to the corresponding user account.
This is handled by a separate tool (not included here) that watches
for updates in the cacl index file and invokes gx-map.

All commands accept a "-help" option to print a brief usage message.
