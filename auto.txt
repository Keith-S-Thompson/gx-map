# This file contains a list of patterns, similar to those in a
# signing_policy file, for DNs that are processed automatically.
# For example, at SDSC certificates from the SDSC and NPACI CAs are
# processed automatically by the gx-check-index command, so it's not
# necessary to handle them manually.
#
# For DNs matching any of these patterns, the gx-request command will
# print a warning before submitting the request.
#
# Comments are ignored.  Uncomment the following lines for SDSC.

# /C=US/O=SDSC/*
# /C=US/O=NPACI/*
