Missing requirements for gx-map on TeraGrid systems
===================================================

NCSA:
    tg-login1.ncsa.teragrid.org (Mercury)
	Perl doesn't have DBI, DBD::Pg
	(This may not be a problem if the DB interaction can be done on
	another node with a shared filesystem.)
	/usr/bin/crontab: permission denied
    co-login1.ncsa.teragrid.org (Cobalt)
	ok
    login-w.ncsa.teragrid.org (Tungsten)
	No access to system
    login-cu.ncsa.teragrid.org (Copper)
	No access to system

SDSC:
    chester.sdsc.edu
	ok
    tg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org
	ok
	(No DBI module, but that's ok, since only chester needs to
	connect to the TGCDB.)
    dslogin.sdsc.teragrid.org
	ok
	(No DBI module, but that's ok, since only chester needs to
	connect to the TGCDB.)
    bg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org
	ok

UC/ANL:
    tg-login1.uc.teragrid.org
	Perl doesn't have DBD::Pg

PSC:
    lemieux.psc.edu
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "128.182.99.155", ...
	The curl command is not installed.  After building it, I had to
	set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/psc/gnu/lib in the cron job for curl
	to work.
    rachel.psc.edu
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "128.182.99.90", ...
	The curl command is not installed.  After building it, I had to
	set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/psc/gnu/lib in the cron job for curl
	to work.
    bigben.psc.edu
	No access to system

IU:
    tg-login1.iu.teragrid.org
	ok
    tg-login-ia32.iu.teragrid.org
	Perl doesn't have Time::HiRes
	Can't use crontab (will need to update /etc/cron.allow)

ORNL:
    tg-login1.ornl.teragrid.org
	/usr/bin/crontab: Permission denied (now ok).
	Otherwise ok

PURDUE:
    tg-login-linux.rcac.purdue.edu
	Ran out of disk quota on home directory (shouldn't be a problem
	for production use).
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "128.211.128.11", ...

TACC:
    lonestar.tacc.utexas.edu
	Perl doesn't have Time::HiRes
	(DB connection ok)
    maverick.tacc.utexas.edu
	Library problem with "curl" command (see TeraGrid Ticket #
	123699), now fixed.
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "129.114.50.3
	Perl code using DBI needs /usr/local/lib in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
