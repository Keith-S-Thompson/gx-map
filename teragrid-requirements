Missing requirements for gx-map on TeraGrid systems
===================================================

Reported via TeraGrid Ticket # 124267, 2006-06-17
Split into one ticket for each site; see below.

Time for each system (e.g., ":55") indicates when it queries the TGCDB
(e.g., 55 minutes after each hour).

NCSA:
    tg-login3.ncsa.teragrid.org (Mercury)
	Perl doesn't have DBI, DBD::Pg
	(This may not be a problem if the DB interaction can be done on
	another node with a shared filesystem -- but NCSA is not
	inclined to do that).
	Had "/usr/bin/crontab: permission denied", but that's fixed.
    co-login1.ncsa.teragrid.org (Cobalt)
	:55
	ok
    login-w.ncsa.teragrid.org (Tungsten)
	:20
	ok
    login-cu.ncsa.teragrid.org (Copper)
	:5
	No curl command (I installed it separately).

    TG Ticket 124268

SDSC:
    chester.sdsc.edu
	:0
	ok
    tg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org
	ok
	(No DBI module, but that's ok, since only chester needs to
	connect to the TGCDB.)
    dslogin.sdsc.teragrid.org
	ok
	(No DBI module, but that's ok, since only chester needs to
	connect to the TGCDB.)
    bg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org
	ok

    TG Ticket 124269 (closed)

UC/ANL:
    :15
    tg-login1.uc.teragrid.org
	Perl didn't have DBD::Pg; fixed.

    TG Ticket 124270
    JP requested a list of the prerequisites; I replied with an
    excerpt from the INSTALL file.

PSC:
    lemieux.psc.edu
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "128.182.99.155", ...
	The curl command is not installed.  After building it, I had to
	set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/psc/gnu/lib in the cron job for curl
	to work.
    rachel.psc.edu
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "128.182.99.90", ...
	The curl command is not installed.  After building it, I had to
	set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/psc/gnu/lib in the cron job for curl
	to work.
    bigben.psc.edu
	No access to system
	I have an account on thunderbolt.psc.edu, which is supposed
	to be equivalent.
	No DBD::Pg module.
	/usr/bin/crontab: Permission denied

    TG Ticket 124271 (closed) (?)

IU:
    tg-login1.iu.teragrid.org
	:50
	ok
    tg-login-ia32.iu.teragrid.org
	Perl doesn't have Time::HiRes
	Had a problem with crontab (cron.allow), ok as of Wed 2006-08-02
	According to Mike Lowe, this system is slated for retirement
	in the near future.

    TG Ticket 124272

ORNL:
    tg-login1.ornl.teragrid.org
	:40
	/usr/bin/crontab: Permission denied (now ok).
	ok

    TG Ticket 124273 (closed)

PURDUE:
    :10
    TG Ticket 124274
    ok

TACC:
    lonestar2.tacc.utexas.edu
	Perl doesn't have Time::HiRes
	(DB connection ok)
    maverick.tacc.utexas.edu

	123699), now fixed.
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "129.114.50.3
	Perl code using DBI needs /usr/local/lib in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    TG Ticket 124275
    Time::HiRes installed on Lonestar and Lonestar2
    (Lonestar2?)
