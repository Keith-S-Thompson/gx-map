    login-cu.ncsa.teragrid.org (Copper)

PSC:
    lemieux.psc.edu

	set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/psc/gnu/lib in the cron job for curl
	to work.
    rachel.psc.edu
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "128.182.99.90", ...
	The curl command is not installed.  After building it, I had to
	set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/psc/gnu/lib in the cron job for curl
	to work.
    bigben.psc.edu

	Otherwise ok

PURDUE:
    tg-login-linux.rcac.purdue.edu
	Ran out of disk quota on home directory (shouldn't be a problem
	for production use).

TACC:
    lonestar.tacc.utexas.edu
	Perl doesn't have Time::HiRes
    maverick.tacc.utexas.edu
	Library problem with "curl" command (see TeraGrid Ticket #
	123699), now fixed.
	no pg_hba.conf entry for host "129.114.50.3
	Perl code using DBI needs /usr/local/lib in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
