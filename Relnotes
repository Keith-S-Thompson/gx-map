Release notes for gx-map

Release 0.4.1, 2004-11-30

    This is a bug fix release.  In release 0.4.0, I inadvertently did
    not implement the REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS configuration option.
    Instead, it unconditionally set the permissions of the requests.log
    file to 400 (readable only by the owner).  This is now corrected.
    (You can still set REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS to 400 if you don't
    want the requests.log file to be world-readable.)

Release 0.4.0, 2004-11-26

    (I've decided to call this release 0.4.0 rather than 0.4 so the
    name of the tarball will sort properly in a directory listing if
    there's a 0.4.1 release.)

    Like previous releases, gx-map 0.4.0 is still somewhat lacking in
    coherent documentation.  It is therefore recommended for users who
    want to upgrade from gx-map 0.3, or who are willing to spend some
    time getting the system working.  Future releases will include
    man pages.

    This release includes several new tools:

	gx-ingest reads an existing grid-mapfile and generates a
	script that invokes gx-map to incorporate the entries into
	the database.

	gx-ca-update downloads and installs certificates, CRLs, and
	signing_policy files.  See README.CA and README.CA-SECURITY
	in this distribution for more information.  Note that this
	can be used independently of the gx-map command; even if you
	don't use gx-map to maintain your grid-mapfile, you can still
	use gx-ca-update to maintain your CA files.

	gx-convert-log converts data from a previous gx-map
	installation for use with gx-map 0.4.

	gx-admins reads an existing requests.log file and guesss which
	users are treated as administrators (useful when upgrading
	from gx-map 0.3).

    Multiple user names can be supported for a grid-mapfile entry by
    treating some mappings as "secondary".

    An administrator may use the "-source" option to specify the
    source of a mapping; this will eventually be used to manage
    cross-site propagation.

    The gx-map system depends critically on checking file ownership
    to confirm that a request was made by an authorized user.
    The gx-check-requests command now fails if a non-root user is
    able to use chown on a file in the new-requests directory.

    The generated grid-mapfile is compatible with both GT2 (OpenSSL
    0.9.6) and GT3 (OpenSSL 0.9.7).  (The expand-grid-mapfile
    command used by some sites with gx-map 0.3 is no longer needed.)
    See <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=575>
    for more information on this issue.

    The syntax of the GLOBUS_ADMINS configuration variable changed from 0.3
    to 0.4.0.  The argument is now a series of one or more space-delimited
    Unix user names.  Group names are no longer allowed.  The "user:"
    prefix is no longer allowed.

    It is recommended that the GLOBUS_ADMINS variable be set to
    a single non-human account name other than "root".  Making a
    human user an admin can cause problems if the account's owner
    leaves the organization.  Using "root" can cause problems if an
    NFS filesystem holding the data files is mounted in a way that
    maps the "root" account to "nobody".  My recommendation: Make the
    "globus" account the only administrative account, make sure any
    administrative users have access to that account.  Be careful not
    to give any untrusted users access to any administrative account.

    The gx-convert-log command supports changing the set of admins in an
    existing requests.log file.

Release 0.3, 2003-07-28

    This should probably be considered beta release.  It included
    fixes for some fairly nasty bugs.  It's been in use at SDSC and
    on several TeraGrid sites since July 2003.

Release 0.2, 2003-07-23

    This was an alpha release, reworked for use at multiple sites.
    It was used briefly at SDSC and on some TeraGrid sites.  It is
    no longer supported, and its use is not recommended.

Release 0.1, date unknown

    This was an SDSC internal system; it was never released.
