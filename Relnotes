Release notes for gx-map

========================================================================
TODO:
Finish updating this for release 0.5.1
Search for "TDB"
========================================================================

Release 0.5.1, date TBD

    This is a new major release.  Some file formats have changed.

    This release changes the name of the "gx-map" client program to
    "gx-request".  For backward compatibility, it's still available as
    "gx-map", but that may be removed in a future release.  The idea
    is to avoid confusion between the name of the client program and
    the name of the package as a whole.  (Ths change was actually
    made in release 0.4.5.)

    The gx-cleanup-logs command is new.

    The optional gx-propagate command is new.

    New command-line options for gx-request:
	-set		    Set mappings for the specified user, giving
			    zero or more DNs which replace all existing
			    DNs for that user.
	-proxy		    Extract a DN from the user's current grid
			    proxy certificate.
	-dn-list-file       Read a list of DNs from a specified text file.
		            Used only with the "-set" option.
    The "-secondary" option has been removed.

    New command-line options for gx-check-requests:
	-[no]propagate	    Invoke gx-propagate as appropriate.
			    Has no effect if gx-propagate is not installed.
	-dryrun		    Passed to the gx-propagate command.
			    Has no effect if gx-propagate is not installed.
    The "-namespace" option has been removed.

    New command-line options for gx-gen-mapfile:
	-compatible	    Generate a grid-mapfile compatible with both
			    GT2 and GT3/GT4.  (This was the default
			    behavior in earlier gx-map releases.)
			    By default, the grid-mapfile is compatible
			    only with GT3/GT4.
	-merge-file file    Merge an existing grid-mapfile into the
			    generated grid-mapfile
	-[no]rcs	    Check the generated grid-mapfile into RCS.
			    The default is "-rcs"; use "-norcs"
			    to disable.
	-force		    Force an update regardless of the timestamps
			    of the input and output files.
    New command-line options for gx-ca-update:
	-ca-list            Specify a text file containing a list of CAs.
	-permissions	    Specify octal permissions for installed files;
			    default is 444.
    The "-all-cas" option has been removed.

    A number of minor bugs have been corrected (none of them are
    serious security flaws).  See the "bugs" subdirectory for details.

    A new subsystem for propagating grid-mapfile information
    across sites has been implemented.  The optional "gx-propagate"
    command acts as a plug-in for the "gx-check-requests' command.
    A version is provided that's designed specifically to work on the
    TeraGrid, using the TGCDB (TeraGrid Central Database) to propagate
    information from one TeraGrid site to another.  The interface is
    intended to be extensible (it remains to be seen whether it lives
    up the intent).  See the gx-propagate(8) man page for details.

    Man pages have finally been added.  The documentation is written
    in Perl's "POD" format and automatically converted to man page
    format during configuration.  The raw *.pod files are also
    installed in the "doc" subdirectory.  The gx-map(7) man page
    provides an overview of the system.  The gx-map-security(7) man
    page discusses security considerations Other man pages document
    individual commands and file formats.

    The information provided in the installation configuration file
    has been modified.  The old GLOBUS_ADMINS attribute has been
    replaced by GX_MAP_OWNER and ADDITIONAL_ADMINS (it is recommended
    that ADDITIONAL_ADMINS should be empty).  The string %VERSION%
    is expanded to the current version number in the installation
    directory.  See "sample.conf" for details.

    The format of the CA description files (*.cadesc) has been updated.
    The INDEX attribute has been deleted.

    A number of *.cadesc files have been added or updated.

    CA certificates that are not self-signed are checked using
    "openssl verify".

    Permissions for generated files are managed more carefully.

    Better defense against attacks on the world-writable new-requests
    directory.

    The gx-map installation must be owned by, and the gx-check-requests
    and gx-ca-update commands must be executed by, the GX_MAP_OWNER
    account (see sample.conf).  The GX_MAP_OWNER may not be root.

    All downloads are done using the "curl" command; the "ncftp" and
    "wget" commands are no longer used.

    The customizable Gridmap_Valid_Mappings Perl module has been
    dropped.  Its functionality has been incorporated into the
    Gridmap_Utils module.  Gridmap_Valid_Mappings was designed to
    support cross-site propagation; this has been re-implemented
    using gx-propagate.

    Timestamps are stored in microsecond resolution (using the
    Time::HiRes Perl module).

    All distinguished names are handled internally using the GT4
    format rather than the GT2 format (i.e., using "/UID=" rather
    than "/USERID=", and "/emailAddress=" rather than "/Email=").
    A GT2-compatible grid-mapfile is not generated by default; use the
    "-compatible" option if necessary.

    Error checking is more rigorous.  More errors, including transient
    network errors that can be handled by falling back to a cached
    copy of a file, are both logged and reported by e-mail.

    All e-mail messages are logged.

    The system attempts to keep track of reported errors.  For example,
    if a CA web site is down, an e-mail notification will only be sent
    once, not every time gx-ca-update is run.  If the web site comes
    back up and then goes down again, another message will be sent.

    Dropped the idea of "secondary" mappings.  A grid-mapfile entry
    can map a single DN to multiple user names, separated by commas:
	"/O=Foo/OU=Bar/CN=John Doe" jdoe,johnd,sys123
    In gx-map 0.4.X, this was handled by requiring the user to treat
    some mappings as "secondary", a feature that turned out to be
    extremely error-prone.  Now the most recently added mapping
    goes first.  To change the order, re-add another mapping.

    If the data directory doesn't exist (e.g., because an NFS
    filesystem isn't mounted), the commands will bail out with a
    clear error message, rather than dying obscurely on the first
    attempt to access something in the data directory.

    Generated grid-mapfiles are (optionally) checked into RCS.

    In gx-request, a "set" request specifies the complete set of DNs
    for the user; it's equivalent to a "remove-user" request followed
    zero or more "add" requests.  This is designed for interaction
    with the TGCDB.  This option is not available in interactive mode.

    The locking mechanism has been improved, and should avoid race
    conditions when the data directory is on an NFS filesystem.

    Internal code cleanup.

Release 0.4.5, 2005-05-07

    This release changes the name of the "gx-map" client program to
    "gx-request".  For backward compatibility, it's still available
    as "gx-map".  The idea is to avoid confusion between the name of
    the client program and the name of the package as a whole.

    Bugs fixed in this release:
    bug-0019 Change name of gx-map client to gx-request

Release 0.4.4, 2005-05-07

    This is a bug fix release.

    The web server for the DOEGrids CA's CRL has a bug that affects the
    cache mechanism.  This release includes a workaround for that bug.

    The Perl getpwuid function on MacOS X behaves differently than
    on other platforms (the result includes an extra element),
    which caused the gx-map command to fail.  This release allows
    for the difference.

    Bugs fixed in this release:
    bug-0020 Work around web server problem for DOEGrids CA CRL
    bug-0024 Don't assume Perl's getpw* functions return 9 elements

Release 0.4.3, 2005-04-26

    This release fixes a minor (and mostly harmless) oversight
    in release 0.4.2.  The file gx-map.conf.in is part of the
    new configuration system, which is not yet complete.  It was
    inadvertently included in release 0.4.2, which could cause some
    confusion.  Release 0.4.3 omits this file (and updates a few
    bug reports).

    There is no functional difference between releases 0.4.2 and 0.4.3.

    Bugs fix in this release:
    bug-0021 gx-map.conf.in mistakenly included in 0.4.2 release

Release 0.4.2, 2005-04-17

    This is primarily a bug fix release, intended to be included
    in NMI release 7.  It also includes some updated *.cadesc files
    (including a new CERTIFICATE_SHA1 attribute).

    This release also includes a "bugs" directory containing several
    bug reports.

    Bugs fixed in this release:
    bug-0001 Removing a secondary mapping crashes gx-gen-mapfile
    bug-0002 Double usernames for primary+secondary mappings
    bug-0003 "ci" command can change requests.log permissions
    bug-0005 New feature: MISSING_CRL_OK attribute in cadesc files.
        (changed attribute name to ALLOW_MISSING_CRL)
    bug-0006 Use SHA1 fingerprints in gx-ca-update
    bug-0009 Better tracebacks on errors

Release 0.4.1, 2004-11-30

    This is a bug fix release.  In release 0.4.0, I inadvertently did
    not implement the REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS configuration option.
    Instead, it unconditionally set the permissions of the requests.log
    file to 400 (readable only by the owner).  This is now corrected.
    (You can still set REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS to 400 if you don't
    want the requests.log file to be world-readable.)

Release 0.4.0, 2004-11-26

    (I've decided to call this release 0.4.0 rather than 0.4 so the
    name of the tarball will sort properly in a directory listing if
    there's a 0.4.1 release.)

    Like previous releases, gx-map 0.4.0 is still somewhat lacking in
    coherent documentation.  It is therefore recommended for users who
    want to upgrade from gx-map 0.3, or who are willing to spend some
    time getting the system working.  Future releases will include
    man pages.

    This release includes several new tools:

        gx-ingest reads an existing grid-mapfile and generates a
        script that invokes gx-map to incorporate the entries into
        the database.

        gx-ca-update downloads and installs certificates, CRLs, and
        signing_policy files.  See README.CA and README.CA-SECURITY
        in this distribution for more information.  Note that this
        can be used independently of the gx-map command; even if you
        don't use gx-map to maintain your grid-mapfile, you can still
        use gx-ca-update to maintain your CA files.

        gx-convert-log converts data from a previous gx-map
        installation for use with gx-map 0.4.

        gx-admins reads an existing requests.log file and guesss which
        users are treated as administrators (useful when upgrading
        from gx-map 0.3).

    Multiple user names can be supported for a grid-mapfile entry by
    treating some mappings as "secondary".

    An administrator may use the "-source" option to specify the
    source of a mapping; this will eventually be used to manage
    cross-site propagation.

    The gx-map system depends critically on checking file ownership
    to confirm that a request was made by an authorized user.
    The gx-check-requests command now fails if a non-root user is
    able to use chown on a file in the new-requests directory.

    The generated grid-mapfile is compatible with both GT2 (OpenSSL
    0.9.6) and GT3 (OpenSSL 0.9.7).  (The expand-grid-mapfile
    command used by some sites with gx-map 0.3 is no longer needed.)
    See <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=575>
    for more information on this issue.

    The syntax of the GLOBUS_ADMINS configuration variable changed from 0.3
    to 0.4.0.  The argument is now a series of one or more space-delimited
    Unix user names.  Group names are no longer allowed.  The "user:"
    prefix is no longer allowed.

    It is recommended that the GLOBUS_ADMINS variable be set to
    a single non-human account name other than "root".  Making a
    human user an admin can cause problems if the account's owner
    leaves the organization.  Using "root" can cause problems if an
    NFS filesystem holding the data files is mounted in a way that
    maps the "root" account to "nobody".  My recommendation: Make the
    "globus" account the only administrative account, make sure any
    administrative users have access to that account.  Be careful not
    to give any untrusted users access to any administrative account.

    The gx-convert-log command supports changing the set of admins in an
    existing requests.log file.

Release 0.3, 2003-07-28

    This should probably be considered a beta release.  It included
    fixes for some fairly nasty bugs.  It was in use at SDSC and on
    several TeraGrid sites starting in July 2003.

Release 0.2, 2003-07-23

    This was an alpha release, reworked for use at multiple sites.
    It was used briefly at SDSC and on some TeraGrid sites.  It is
    no longer supported, and its use is not recommended.

Release 0.1, date unknown

    This was an SDSC internal system; it was never released.
