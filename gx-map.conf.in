#
# configure-gx-map reads "gx-map.conf.in" and generates "gx-map.conf".
# Variables may be set via command-line arguments to configure-gx-map,
# or to some default value.
# Each command reads gx-map.conf during initialization at run time.
#
# gx-map.conf may be edited after installation.
# Variables set to UNDEF must be set to some valid value.
#
# Comments starting with '#' are ignored, as are empty lines.
#

#
# The full path to the Perl interpreter.
# This must be set during configuration and installation.
#
PERL            /usr/bin/perl  # Do not edit this line

#
# The value to be used for $PATH.
# This will be used to find the following commands:
#     wget ncftpget (for downloading remote files)
#     rcs ci        (for RCS)
#     openssl
#     hostname
#
PATH            /bin:/usr/bin

#
# The default namespace.
# A namespace, in this context, is a mapping of Unix user names and
# numeric UIDs to people.  (It may correspond to a DNS domain if all
# relevant systems within that domain have consistent user names and
# numeric UIDs.)
#
NAMESPACE       UNDEF

#
# The installation directory for the gx-map package.
# This must be set during configuration and installation.
#
INSTALL_DIR     UNDEF  # Do not edit this line

#
# The default directory containing data for the gx-map system.
# On installation, INSTALL_DIR/var will be created as a symlink
# to this directory.
# This must be set during configuration and installation.
#
DATA_DIR        UNDEF  # Do not edit this line

#
# Permissions for the requests.log file.
# Supported values are:
#     444 (world-readable)
#     440 (group-readable)
#     400 (readable only by owner)
#
REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS 444

#
# The name of the Unix account that owns the gx-map installation.
# This cannot be "root", or any account with UID 0.  This account
# must be used to run install-gx-map (invoked by "make install")
# and the gx-check-requests and gx-ca-update commands.
#
# Recommended practice is to use a non-personal account.  "globus" is
# usually a good choice, or you can create a special account for the
# purpose.  Using a personal account can cause problems if the owner
# of the account leaves the organization; the account name still needs
# to be recognized as an administrator in old requests.log entries.
#
# This account is allowed to run the "gx-request" command on behalf
# of other users, so access to this account *must* be guarded as
# carefully as access to the root account.
#
GX_MAP_OWNER sample

#
# A space-separated list of zero or more users who are allowed to
# run gx-map on behalf of other users.  These are in addition to the
# account specified in GX_MAP_OWNER.
#
# Recommended practice is to leave this empty, allowing only a
# single administrative account.  All the security considerations
# for GX_MAP_OWNER apply equally to ADDITIONAL_ADMINS.
#
ADDITIONAL_ADMINS

#
# An e-mail address for notifications of significant actions.
# This is currently used only by gx-ca-update.
#
ADMIN_EMAIL     UNDEF

#
# A Perl source file with an alternative implementation of the
# Valid_Mappings function.  If UNDEF, use the default implementation.
# This must be set (if it's set at all) during configuration and
# installation.
#
VALID_MAPPINGS_FILE   UNDEF  # Do not edit this line

#
# A Perl source file that implements the gx-propagate command,
# to be invoked as needed by gx-check-requests.  If not specified,
# no gx-propagate command will be installed; there is no default
# implementation.  (Currently, a TeraGrid-specific version is included
# in the distribution.)

GX_PROPAGATE      UNDEF  # Do not edit this line
