#
# configure-gx-map reads "gx-map.conf.in" and generates "gx-map.conf".
# Variables may be set via command-line arguments to configure-gx-map,
# or to some default value.
# Each command reads gx-map.conf during initialization at run time.
#
# gx-map.conf may be edited after installation, but certain variables
# may not be modified (they're marked with comments to that effect).
#
# Comments introduced by '#' are ignored, as are empty lines.
#

#
# The full path to the Perl interpreter.
# This must be set during configuration and installation.
# It must be at least version 5.006, and it must provide the following
# modules:
#     File::Basename  (standard)
#     File::Copy      (standard)
#     Getopt::Long    (standard)
#     Time::Local     (standard)
#     Cwd             (standard)
#
#     Net::Domain     (if missing, fall back to hostname command)
#
#     Time::HiRes     (standard in newer versions of Perl;
#                     if missing, fall back to external gettimeofday
#                     command, which must be installed separately)
#
# The following modules are required for TeraGrid systems only:
#     DBI             (needed by TeraGrid version of gx-propagate and
#                     the TGCDB subsystem)
#     DBD::Pg         (needed by DBI)
#
PERL

#
# The value to be used for $PATH.
# This will be used to find the following commands:
#     curl             (for downloading remote files)
#     rcs ci           (for RCS)
#     openssl          (to extract information from certificates)
#     gzip tar         (for gx-install-cadesc)
#     hostname         (ignored if Net::Domain Perl module is available)
#     mail or mailx    (optional; if missing, diagnostics will not be
#                       delivered by e-mail)
#     gettimeofday     (ignored if Time::HiRes Perl module is available;
#                       see INSTALL for details)
#
# Be sure that all specified directories, and all their parent
# directories, are writable only by trusted users.  If an attacker is
# able to install a Trojan openssl or curl, for example, he can break
# into another user's account.
#
PATH

#
# The default namespace.
# This must be set during configuration and installation (future releases
# may allow it to be modified later.)
# A namespace, in this context, is a mapping of Unix user names and
# numeric UIDs to people.  (It may correspond to a DNS domain if all
# relevant systems within that domain have consistent user names and
# numeric UIDs.)
#
NAMESPACE

#
# The installation directory for the gx-map package.
# The gx-map package may be installed either in its own directory or
# in a shared directory (such as $GLOBUS_LOCATION).
#
INSTALL_DIR

#
# The default directory containing data for the gx-map system.
# On installation, INSTALL_DIR/gx-map-data will be created as a symlink
# to this directory.
#
DATA_DIR

#
# Permissions for the requests.log file.
# Supported values are:
#     444 (world-readable)
#     440 (group-readable)
#     400 (readable only by owner)
#
REQUESTS_LOG_PERMISSIONS

#
# The name of the Unix account that owns the gx-map installation.
# This cannot be "root", or any account with UID 0.  This account
# must be used to run install-gx-map (invoked by "make install")
# and the gx-check-requests and gx-ca-update commands.
#
# Recommended practice is to use a non-personal account.  A dedicated
# "gxmap" account is the best choice.  The "globus" account is also
# a possibility, particularly if you choose to install gx-map under
# $GLOBUS_LOCATION.  Using a personal account can cause problems if the
# owner of the account leaves the organization.
#
# The specified account is allowed to run the "gx-request" command on
# behalf of other users, so access to this account *must* be guarded as
# carefully as access to the root account.
#
GX_MAP_OWNER

#
# A space-separated list of zero or more users who are allowed to
# run gx-map on behalf of other users.  These are in addition to the
# account specified in GX_MAP_OWNER.
#
# Recommended practice is to leave this empty, allowing
# only a single administrative account.  All the security
# considerations for GX_MAP_OWNER apply equally to each
# account listed in ADDITIONAL_ADMINS.
#
ADDITIONAL_ADMINS

#
# An e-mail address for notifications of significant events.
#
ADMIN_EMAIL

#
# The directory containing the CA certificates needed to check signatures.
# A reasonable default is "/etc/grid-security/certificates".
#
CERTIFICATES_DIR

#
# A Perl source file that implements the gx-propagate command,
# to be invoked as needed by gx-check-requests.  If not specified,
# no gx-propagate command will be installed; there is no default
# implementation.  (Currently, the distribution includes a dummy test
# version, "gx-propagate.in.test", and a TeraGrid-specific version,
# "gx-propagate.in.teragrid").  This may be left empty.
#
# If you want to provide your own implementation, its name must begin
# with "gx-propagate.in.".  You can either provide a full pathname, or
# copy the file to the source directory before running "configure-gx-map".
#
GX_PROPAGATE

#
# The EXTRAS attribute can be used to specify additional components to be
# installed.  The only currently supported value is TGCDB, which causes a
# set of TeraGrid-specific tools to be installed.  This may be left empty.
#
EXTRAS
